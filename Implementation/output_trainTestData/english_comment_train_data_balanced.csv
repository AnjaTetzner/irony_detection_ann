"Why Taibbi is not on every news source all the time, I will never know.  The man is a genius."
That just makes me cringe.   Not sure if it's the use of memes to try to appeal to teenagers or the fact that this song won't stop harassing me (I GET IT YOU GUYS THAT'S SO FUNNY I'M A FOX).

"I am proud to wear this shirt as a symbol of my transition into my more mature years.  What lady could mourn the change of the two ""pups"" under her shirt when she can wear THREE strong wolves ON her shirt?"
"What a steaming pile of horseshit.   I guess democrats have all the answers to all the world's problems and republicans have nothing good to say whatsoever.   We can just dismiss them all.   This kind of thinking is what's wrong with partisan politics, and as a matter of fact it's what's wrong with most religious thinking as well.   ""We have all the answers and we're not going to talk you because you're wrong. ""  It's so childish."
"This will bring your toys to life.I recently knitted a small little ragdoll out of brown fabric. And then I thought: ""What if there was a way he could be brought to life?"" And it was the best idea ever. And then I couldn't sleep. And when I did, I had nightmares about the non-life of my ragdoll. I had no idea how to bring inanimate objects to life, and it seemed I would have nightmares forever....And then I found this product. Seeing as everybody else had truly magical results from this work of art, I gave it a try. Not for me though-For my ragdoll. Since he was too small to wear the shirt, I melted it into pure liquid extract of the divine lupine power. I injected it into the ragdoll, and closed the hole up with a zipper.And he got up. He walked around for the first time. He fell down, but I helped him through life. And I named him Sackboy. Because he was crocheted from a brown bag. But not a paper one. He recently aquired a small device we call a Popit. He has taught himself to create with it.I also injected it into my old scuba suit. The lights came on! I named him Big Daddy, because the suit belonged to my dad. For some reason, he and Sackboy fight."
"I was not at all pleased with my uranium ore... Sure the shipping was speedy, but at what cost? I purchased this Item in order to achieve myself a second genetalia, for better results in my polygamist relationship.... All I can say is, I am not happy... I now have not 2, but 3 breasts. The only reason I'm giving this review 3 stars and not 1 is because while in the process of injecting myself with the uranium ore, I somehow obtained the power of X-ray vision... Which is pretty good, especially when you have 3 breasts"

Man was I surprised!!It was kind of hard, so I popped it in the microwave for a while.  When it came out I decided to just try a sandwhich with it and peanut butter since it wasn't going to spread easily.  The taste was magnifcent.  It was a little earthy, but made my tongue, tonsils, throat, stomach and colon tingle!  Absolutely amazing!The only problem was the florescent stool for the next week.  It was so florescent that I could have sworn it was glowing.."
LOVE IT.  Tons of compliments
"Never, is that soon enough?"
"Dear Bic,How dare you contribute to the brainwashing of women that to be thin and skinny is the only proper female shape? I note that your new ""Bic for Her"" pens come in only the one size. Well news for you, ""one-size"" DEFINITELY does not fit ALL!Most women are not model thin, size 0; what is the average, hard-working female supposed to grip? Why are the majority of us relegated to ugly, plain-looking pens that you've pointed out with your ""for HER"" branding, are by default the pens of mannish, unfeminine women? Is there no compassion for the legions of females you're insinuating must go on diets?And I find it very frightening that these pens are not only skinny, but devoid of breasts and hips. Are we back in the age of Twiggy? Must more models faint and die on the runway from lack of calories?Or is this another ploy of the Patriarchy, to infantilize women? These pens are sparkly, pastel-colored, and look girlish - not for women ""of a certain age."" They look like they're perfect for licking while twirling your hair. Is Bic suggesting REAL women are Lolitas?Gloria Steinem and Camille Paglia, where are you?"
"I live in Washington. After using this product, I have become very tall and overbearingly hairy. Since I can no longer fit in with society, I will join my brethren in the Inland North West forests.

"I was very excited to finally acquire the Hutzler 571. On its initial release, I was one of those idiots who camped out all night at the Hutzler store to be the first one to get one. They were actually really cool about it, and local news stations did a typical fluff piece, yadda yadda yadda. But fast forward to a week after release, and I discovered to my dismay - the Hutzler 571 banana slicer DOES NOT WORK ON FROZEN BANANAS. Nowhere in the instructions, documentation, or safety warnings did it say anything about this.So, I basically ruined my precious Hutzler 571 banana slicer, failed to slice my banana (because it was frozen) and then, to make matters worse, my warrantee (and I paid for the extended two year platinum warrantee, by the way!) didn't cover ""user error."" The folks at the Hutzler Genius Bunch were really nice about it, but at the end of the day, I had to pay for a replacement.So be forewarned, the Hutzler 571 does NOT WORK ON FROZEN BANANAS. (It works fine on bananas that have been pureed, however, or at any rate, without any damage to the product.  Three stars from me since it's otherwise so great."
"This thing is awesome!  I feel like some people may be under-utilizing it, though.  Through trial and error, I have found that it works just as well on hot dogs (if you bend them a little before placing them under slicer).  Also, string cheese works nicely.  Bread sticks do pretty well as do Twinkies.  I did not have such great luck with beef jerky or raw-hide dog chews.  Oh well, you can't expect one product to do literally everything.  But,if you ever want to make a banana, hot dog, bread stick, and Twinkie salad, this product is all you will need!  Thanks Hutzler!"
I'm so upset with these pens that I broke them all. They really ARE delicately made for women.Why aren't these color coded? I think purple pens should write purple! Leave the boring black ink for men.
"Every morning, I would easily spend 15-20 seconds slicing up my banana using an archaic knife.  Now, that time is cut in half.  Shaving those precious seconds off the day now gives me time to:1. Wash the banana out of all the slicing blades with an old toothbrush2. Find and wipe down my cutting board used for the banana slicing3. Clean that archaic knife that is now only used to scoop the banana slices off the cutting board and into my cerial.How did I ever have breakfast without you?"
"""""""Get milk on your way home from work.""""  How many husbands have not heard that one before and mumbled something about driving west until the car runs out of gas and then and there starting a new life with a new identity.  The THM is a no-brainer.  A few strokes on the key board and it's BOOM, WINNING!  One gallon of milk delivered straight to your office.  Did I mention this is """"Tuscan"""" whole milk?  One gulp and I'm back in Sicily asking my Capo who's on the off list for the day.  Sure it seems a little pricey.  In fact, the last time I checked prices for milk non-Tuscan whole milk selling for about $3.50.  $45.00 is not that much money for a gallon of milk when it's the Tuscan and because my organization politely suggests that we'd like you to buy it anyway so nothing happens.  Besides, when you combine a glass of Tuscan with right-angled banana slices prepared by the Huntzler 571 Banana Slicer and you are already a winner before walking out the door to face the day."""
This is totally unacceptable. Anyone that spends $45.00 for a gallon of milk should have thier head examined. This is just as bad as spending 60 dollars for 2 dozen crossaints.

"I love the pens for her but feel that you've left out several women. These pens cater to women who look good in ""spring"" colors. However, I am an ""autumn/fall"" and the colors that accentuate my features best are mustard yellow, browns or rust colors. I would love to see pens for her customized and designated ""summer, winter, fall, or spring."" 3/4's of women are being left out in a very unflattering way. When I write in my recipe book for the fall holidays I want to be presenting my best look. Thank you!"

I managed to make it 37 miles into the mantle before I lost telemetry. A super slow-motion replay of the internal video feed clearly shows the cabin collapsing just prior to loss of signal. I guess my search for Unobtainium resumes... Sigh..."

"As a professional Mohel I am always looking for ways to expedite the circumcision process so I can get straight to the sacramental wine.  When I heard there was a dedicated ""Banana"" slicer I was, needless to say, excited.  However, this device is entirely ineffective at ""Banana"" slicing.  As a consequence of some circumcision mishaps, I have now had to promise over 25 free Bar Mitzvah ceremonies (or Bat Mitvahs, depending on the availability of reconstructive surgery) to the parents of the children.  Do not attempt to use this product for circumcision!  Please stick to your favorite rusty knives or, for the traditionalists amongst us, semi-automatic pistols."
"So I bought this shirt just because basically i saw a bunch of really b/a looking dudes walking around the local malls wearing it and thought, ""I want to be awesome again"". Well after my purchase, i started to read some of the reviews and saw the powers that this shirt posseses and quite frankly I am a little scared to wear it out on the town. I am happily married and I fear that wearing this may cause other women to fight for my manliness, which could lead to divorce, bankruptcy, personal injury and possible death... So I am still looking for the right opportunity to sport this type of power around other people. I do wear it at home alone for a couple hours at a time, and let me just say it works 10 times better than that roll on under your arm crap for testosterone increases. On a side note, strangely every night while hanging in my closet, any shirt that has a graphic of a woman on it alters itself to show her in a bowing position and there is always 8 to 10 inches of space on both sides of the hanger when I look in the closet the next morning. Very strange, very strange indeed..."
"Well thank goodness I've gotten my banana slicing time down from 14 seconds to 1.5 seconds per day (a 12.5 second savings!) That was a huge relief.  BUT I have to say I think this product should come with its own cleaning device because I spent the next 7  MINUTES trying to adequately get my dish sponge around all of the little blades to clean it!  Since cleaning a paring knife only takes me about 4 seconds that's 6 minutes, 56 seconds wasted.  So cleaning it ate up the savings of 33 banana slicings!I'm a busy person and I have a life to lead here.I started working on my own and I think I came up with a fix.  Take a dish sponge and cut slices into it using a sharp pair of scissors at precisely the width of the banana slicing blades.  Wet and add soap, then guide the sponge fingers in between the blades.  Repeat 1-2 times and you're done!Yes, it'll take you about 2.5 minutes to make the custom sponge but that's something you only have to do once in a while and it should take your banana slicer cleaning time down to somewhat more acceptable levels."

"Thank goodness for this AMAZING product, the 571B banana slicer. CPA was really starting to hound me for forcing my children to prepare their own breakfasts. Something about them being ""too young"" and giving them ""deadly weapons"" with their breakfast. A banana and a butcher knife? Really CPA? Obviously bananas require sharp knives. And the fact that other children AREN'T making their own breakfast is probably why children are in gangs, stealcars, and mail anthrax in envelopes. Training my precious babies ( 2 years old and 9 months) to be independent from the start will prevent them from partaking in the nonsense. And now I have CPA off my back. Thank you 571B banana slicer!!"
"As a lady firefighter, I've long known that the key to success lies in my personal sense of style and the delicacy I'm able to bring to my everyday tasks.  Sadly, my career has thus far been hampered by the awkward, ill-fitting men's pens I've been forced to use on the job.  My notes on fire behavior and weather patterns, not to mention patient vitals, have always borne the blot of masculine execution, and I firmly believe that it is this unwitting failure of chic that's kept my salary below that of many of my colleagues.  However, thanks to Bic Cristal [sic] 'For Her' Ball Pens, I'm finally getting the recognition I deserve.  Thanks, Bic!

My twin is much smaller than I am, and has limited digital capability (ie, he has no fingers and can't type), so I'm writing this for the both of us. He is, however, much smarter than I am, despite his size (he weighs about 600 grams - roughly the size of a single container of Jenny-O Ground Turkey Breast). That aside, we are both suffering from a severe case of non-paternal/maternal/fraternal baldness of the lower-frontal neck (we are both neck-beard enthusiasts, although his is more like the tip of a paint brush), and fingers crossed, experimenting with the Uranium for explosive growth.

"My plan was to buy the Three Wolf Moon Shirt to compliment my beard features. But little did I know, the Three Wolf Moon Shirt would do more than just compliment my natural red highlights (which the ladies already went crazy for). Paying only five rupees, I put on the Three Wolf Moon Shirt which caused my beard to be the cosmic power itself. I guess the natural hairs of my glorious beard, coupled with the magical powers of the Three Wolf Moon Shirt unlocked the ultimate powers of the universe. Now I'm defeating villains and battling Satan in my spare time due to being God's vision of the future. My mother was so proud she began to cry hot sauce, which when applied to the right meats, can cure cancer. Grandma will now live forever. I love you, Nana.

"Well sure the Hutzler 571 works for your average everyday banana, but some of us have bananas that bring a little more to the kitchen... if you know what I'm saying!  That's why I ordered the Hutzler 571M (Magnum)!  While many men tend to lie about the size of their bananas, some bananas are just genetically bigger than others.  The 571M will slice up to a 12 inch banana, although most will tell you that once you get over about a 9 inch banana it is just too much!  NOTE: Make sure you don't confuse this for the Hutzler 571m (micro).  This is designed for your 1-3 inch banana.  Although functional, I think you'll find that with any banana smaller than about 5 inches you'll be left unsatisfied and disappointed... you're probably better off just leaving these bananas left unpeeled."

The power of the image just overwhelmed me.  I knew I was in over my head.  In my heart I knew I wasn't worthy to dawn this majestic cloth.A couple of days passed and I gathered the nerve to wear it.  Looking at my pregnant girlfriend I could tell it made her uneasy.

"I ordered this shirt on Tuesday, and patiently waited for it's arrival on Friday. It arrived exactly on time, and the ups man planted the package in my hands. After taking the three wolf shirt out of the package I felt the need go immediately put it on.My initial feelings towards wearing the shirt were nothing out of the ordinary so I decided to take a glance at myself in the mirror. Immediately I noticed that it seemed as if I gained 15 pounds of solid muscle. I'm a pretty fit man to begin with, and I have been at a plateau in the gym recently so this was a welcome sight.With the perception of  being more muscular already accomplished, I decided to hit the gym with my brand new three wolf shirt on. Upon entering the gym I was approached by, what seemed like, the whole Zumba class that had just finished. I received at least a bakers dozen compliments from these beautiful women, and I proceeded into the weight room.I took a quick look around and came to the conclusion that I was the biggest man in the gym, which I have never felt before. I decided to try the bench press and put my previous max up to see how it felt. After knocking out 50 reps of my personal record I added 200 more pounds onto the bar to see how it felt. While lifting my new and improved max I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and couldn't help but notice a strong resemblance to Dwayne Johnson wearing a three wolf shirt.This product will not disappoint you, if you are looking to take your life to the next level I would highly recommend this product."

"Whole Milk (Tuscany, Greece) is an artist who works in a variety of media. With a subtle minimalistic approach, Milk creates intense personal moments masterfully created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round and round in circles.His practice provides a useful set of allegorical tools for manoeuvring with a pseudo-minimalist approach in the world of art: these meticulously planned works resound and resonate with images culled from the fantastical realm of imagination. By using popular themes such as sexuality, family structure and violence, he uses a visual vocabulary that addresses many different social and political issues. The work incorporates time as well as space - a fictional and experiential universe that only emerges bit by bit.His works bear strong political references. The possibility or the dream of the annulment of a (historically or socially) fixed identity is a constant focal point. By merging several seemingly incompatible worlds into a new universe, he touches various overlapping themes and strategies. Several reoccurring subject matter can be recognised, such as the relation with popular culture and media, working with repetition, provocation and the investigation of the process of expectations.His works often refers to pop and mass culture. Using written and drawn symbols, a world where light-heartedness rules and where rules are undermined is created. By emphasising aesthetics, he seduces the viewer into a world of ongoing equilibrium and the interval that articulates the stream of daily events. Moments are depicted that only exist to punctuate the human drama in order to clarify our existence and to find poetic meaning in everyday life.His works doesn't reference recognisable form. The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. With the use of appropriated materials which are borrowed from a day-to-day context, he presents everyday objects as well as references to texts, painting and architecture. Pompous writings and Utopian constructivist designs are juxtaposed with trivial objects. Categories are subtly reversed.His collected, altered and own works are being confronted as aesthetically resilient, thematically interrelated material for memory and projection. The possible seems true and the truth exists, but it has many faces, as Hanna Arendt cites from Franz Kafka. By questioning the concept of movement, he absorbs the tradition of remembrance art into daily practice. This personal follow-up and revival of a past tradition is important as an act of meditation.He creates situations in which everyday objects are altered or detached from their natural function. By applying specific combinations and certain manipulations, different functions and/or contexts are created. By applying abstraction, he creates work in which a fascination with the clarity of content and an uncompromising attitude towards conceptual and minimal art can be found. The work is aloof and systematic and a cool and neutral imagery is used.His works sometimes radiate a cold and latent violence. At times, disconcerting beauty emerges. The inherent visual seductiveness, along with the conciseness of the exhibitions, further complicates the reception of their manifold layers of meaning. By contesting the division between the realm of memory and the realm of experience, he finds that movement reveals an inherent awkwardness, a humour that echoes our own vulnerabilities. The artist also considers movement as a metaphor for the ever-seeking man who experiences a continuous loss.His works isolate the movements of humans and/or objects. By doing so, new sequences are created which reveal an inseparable relationship between motion and sound."

"My friends and I are avid milk connoisseurs.  We have spent years searching the globe for the best dairy excretions available to the general public.  These last few years have been particularly subpar, depressing even.  In our Journey of Many Laments to Nepal, we stumbled upon a curious village in the himalayas.The local shaman greeted us at the airport in his 1967 Ford GT 40 and provided food and lodging in his flat.  After acclimating to the harsh conditions, our vigor was rejuvenated.  He then kindly directed us to what we now consider our first real breakthrough in the search. The shaman brought us to the aristocratic monk troup 509. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, these monks practice the rare art of cold fusion. After the intense initiation, we became brothers of the clan. After a fortnight of pillow fights and toga parties in celebration of our success, a poignant epiphany of our rash decision came to light. We couldn't afford the 5 dollar initiation fees.  Leaving in shame we visited the local walmart. And it was there that we saw a man in a green pair of taco pants that glistened with the sauted oil of onions and fruit snacks.  This man looked at us with a strange expression chiseled on face. It was a mixture of anguish and enlightenment. We asked the man 'Are you selling any milk?'  He replied with a furtive look to a cloud shaped like a bong in a whirlwind, 'Yes. Tuscan whole milk extracted from the teets Chuck Norris'."

"Bless the Tuscan whole milk, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless its holy name.Bless the Tuscan whole milk, O my soul, and do not forget all its benefits--who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases,who redeems your life from the Pit of Osteoporosis, who crowns you with steadfast bone structure,who satisfies you with icy frosty good flavor as long as you drink from a glass that's been in the freezer.The Tuscan whole milk works vindication and justice for all who are oppressed.It makes known its ways to Moses, who might have sold his soul for it in the desert had it been available.Tuscan whole milk is merciful and gracious, slow to spoil and abounding in Vitamin D.It will not always accuse, nor spew vile phrases about 2% milk being healthier.It does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is its nutrition for those who drink it;as far as the east is from the west, so far it removes our transgressions from us.As a father has compassion for his children, so the Tuscan whole milk has compassion for those who drink it.For it knows how we were made; it remembers that we are dust.As for mortals, their days are like grass; they flourish like a flower of the field;for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.But the Tuscan whole milk is from everlasting to everlasting as long as there are cows to produce it, and its righteousness to children's children,to those who keep to the USDA dietary recommendations and remember to do the food pyramid.Tuscan whole milk has established its throne in the heavens, and its kingdom rules over all.Bless the Tuscan whole milk, O you angels, you mighty ones who do its bidding, obedient to its spoken word.Bless the Tuscan whole milk, all the cows, its ministers that do its will.Bless the Tuscan whole milk, all its works, in all places of its dominion. Bless the Tuscan whole milk, O my soul."

"I was skeptical when I first found this listing. Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is my absolute favorite milk. I know some milk afficianados go for that frou-frou Central American arboreal sloth milk, or pure bred Byzantine lineage mountain goat milk with extra cream, and I understand that - it's all delicious, but this stuff is the ambrosia of the dairygods and the price listed here is unheard of at less than a dollar an ounce!My first appetizing taste of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz came in the 80's. I'd just seen David Bowie perform ""Let's Dance"" at a private club somewhere in LA, and ended up in a limo ride to one of those 6-star establishments afterwards. Haven't heard of a 6-star place? Phbbbt. Figures, you prole. Anyway, I ordered a BPB (beluga caviar and peanut butter sandwich - all the rage then) and they served it up fresh with delicious Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz. Since then, I can't eat a beluga and peanut butter sammich with anything else.Despite my skepticism, a friend heard me raving about how good this was with BPBs and ordered several jugs. I have to say, this Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is the genuine article, and oh so smooth. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. ;)"

I didn't want anyone to see the package sitting out in my building's community mail area. But I just got out of a LTR so I was desperate. As soon as my pens arrived, I got to buisness. But I didn't see an on switch. There wasn't a plug either, so I knew it wasn't going to be that powerful. But the pastel, feminine colors! Oh...I was so turned on. It was a little scratchy at first, but I got there. The actual mechanics of the pen was less than great, but the thought, and intent behind Bic's creation of the pens was jaw droppingly hot.

That Diane Lane was just a disaster but she went there and ate all those bowls of noodles and now look at her! She married Josh Brolin.[UPDATE: they are divorcing. Perhaps another trip to Tuscany is in order]Are Italian cows more nutritious than American cows? Is their milk more invigorating? What types of grasses do they eat: wheat grass? lawn grass? Easter? Is Italy closer to the sun? If I drink their milk, will I soil myself by midmorning? These are all questions I sought to answer.Fact: I should have been more thoughtful about how I planned my day after consuming a 48 oz glass of Tuscan Whole Milk and a wedge of melted brie. Why I chose to take a leisurely swim at the pool directly after is still a mystery to me. Again, my most profuse apologies to the members of the Senior Ladies Swim Club as well the participants of the Family Open Swim. The parents present there were particularly horrified.Although my expirement ended in humiliation and mass hysteria, I still have to give Tuscan Whole Milk 5 stars because it is delicious and filling and I detected notes of oak and boysenberry when I drank it. I have no explanation for why a cow would be consuming such things, but who am I to question it? It is what it is."

When this thing can slice a beer can, I'll reconsider purchasing more for my friends and neighbors.  And for godsake, employ some ergonometric engineering on the next model.

"I bought these for my wife and my life will never be the same.  It started innocently enough, she was writing a lot, sketching and doodles, poems all kinds of stuff.  One day I found one with teeth marks, I told biting wasn't good for it.  I attempted to talk to her about it one day, you know communication, she said I was over reacting and imagining things.  It helped though, I didn't ""see"" her doing it anymore, but the pens kept running out of ink even though she supposedly wasn't using them anymore.  Post-it notes and doodles would mysteriously appear here and there.  Then I started finding poems and notes hidden under her pillow and stuffed under the mattress on her side of the bed.  I found a notebook that she was writing a short story in and I found her diary.  All kinds of sketches and writings, in different colors, in print and in cursive, it was devastating.  Turns out she was buying more behind my back too, the final straw though...inks stain on her collar.  She claims it was from the filling in her doughnut at breakfast but it just happened to match the color of the ink on her grocery list for the day.  The divorce will be finalized tomorrow."

"Tonight is the Super Moon, Sunday August 10th 2014. I find it an appropriate time to share my very true story about this thrice great wolf / supermoon shirt. I saw my very old friend wearing this shirt in a picture where he was sitting on a large rock at the beach. Even though he tore the sleeves off to look hardcore. I could still tell there was something different about him. He seemed to have transcended the common reality we normally perceive. Leaning on a rock with a wolf like stare, brandishing three (3) wolves, two (2) facing north, one (1) facing south, all howling at the sky from an invisible cliff or plateau, so close to the moon they could almost touch it with their noses. The wolves breath so cold as if to float in front of the moon like a frigid night cloud. All happening while my friend stares icy death into the unsuspecting lens. Chilling to the core.... Like when you hold two mirrors up to each other, they reflect towards infinity, or staring into the bottomless darkness of a well. The wolves became a reflection of the moon, and my friend became a reflection of the wolves, almost as if he himself had become one with their pack and entered into their world. Or had he allowed the three (3) wolves a doorway into ours?. When I asked him about the shirt, he simply replied; ""Killer Wolf"". I was startled! Did he mean they; the three (3) were killer wolves? But he didn't say ""Killer Wolves"". He said ""Killer Wolf""! The more I sat and thought about his response, I wondered... Is he saying ""I'm The Wolf""? Whoa!!! Anyways... I pressed him a little more about the shirt. He told me, it helped him ""sing better"". Now I have known this friend for a long time, and he has always been in bands. But dig this! Come to find out since he started wearing the Three (3) Wolf Shirt, he has blown up on the scene and played alongside tons of legendary rock acts. So to make a long story short. He is a Famous Rock Star Now! Wow! Three (3) Wolf Shirt plus (+) Super Moon = Legendary Rock Star!"

I bought this product to keep in my emergency pack for the time machine I built. A year later I found myself stranded in the Jurassic Period with all hope lost of returning home.

"How do I know that this is really a ""whole milk""? I have heard of milks that are larger and smaller that 128 oz. Is this blended like scotch? Or is it single origin, udder-aged?Either way, I was unhappy with it. Milk was a BAD choice."
"I grew up in a small town in the midwest in a pretty big family. 32 kids and 4 house chickens. My father worked at a paper mill, my mother sold cloth at a fabric store. Ironically we didn't have a single book in the house (ironic because books are usually made out of paper) nor did we have a single item of clothing (well, what one would normally think of as clothing: all our clothes were made of fruit bags we would save from the grocer's and sew into shirts, pants, hats, shoes (etc) at the dinner table as my father read scripture) We were always struggling financially. Not because of my parent's mediocre blue-collar jobs or the cost of raising nearly three dozen children. We struggled financially mostly due to medical bills involving the chickens (they all had diabetes and one of them had a bad back). Even though we barely had enough money to eat, my father would always make sure our refrigerator was stocked to the absolute bourgeoning limit with Tuscan Whole Milk 1 Gallon. In fact, for several months we survived exclusively on Tuscan Whole milk, bypassing solid food altogether. And to be honest I can't remember a happier time in my life.  When my wife asked me to describe my childhood on our first date, I looked up at her from across the table where we had been trying to enjoy a bottle of lobster port and said, ""creamy."" And you know what? Creamy sounded pretty good to her in comparison to that lobster port. Needless to say, we were married within a week."
"While yellow may seem like the most appropriate color for a banana slicer, I've found that when working with large numbers of bananas the tool can get lost in the pile.  I'd prefer a high-contrast color to aid in location during a serious slicing session.  Additionally, when working with a team, there is often confusion as to who owns what slicer, one time resulting in an argument that ended a long-time friendship.  We now mark all of our Hutzler 571 Banana Slicers with a Sharpie, but having color options would be a welcome feature in a future version."

"I hear the doorbell ring and I look out my window to see a delivery truck pulling away from in front of my house.  As I walk out to my front porch and retrieve the item left behind, I notice that many of my neighbors have already stepped out from their houses; peering in my direction, I imagine out of curiosity.  I walk back inside and open the package, and there it is, to my amazement- the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt…  Glowing with virility.  Without hesitation, I put the shirt on.  A surge of energy is released and rushes through my body.  Just then I hear a loud, “BANG”.  I look toward the front door and then another, “BANG.… BANG BANG!”  I walk over and as I turn the door handle, I feel an enormous push coming from the other side.  I use my shoulder to stop the tornado of arms, feet, and fingernails that all try to force their way through my door.  I somehow manage to close the door shut and lock it.  When I peak through the window, I see that it is WOMEN that are just throwing themselves at my door!  Literally, tens of hundreds of WOMEN sprinting down the street and launching themselves at my door!!  “Crash” the sound of glass shattering from my front window.  Women spawning from the opening; clawing and gnashing.. pulling at each other’s hair to get through.  Frightened, I race up the stairs and down the long hallway toward the back room, hearing the stampede just behind me.  As I get closer and closer to the room, I realize my fatal error.. I have trapped myself.  Without breaking stride and no place left to go, I hurl myself through the back window.  Flailing my arms and legs as I come crashing toward the ground.  With nothing to break my fall, I tuck my shoulder and somersault back up to my feet and continue running frantically.  I look to my left and swarms of women are pouring into the street parallel to me.  That’s when I realize, it’s the shirt! It must be the shirt!  Still running, I desperately try to remove the shirt but it is a futile attempt.  The shirt seems to have fused itself to my body!  As I make my way to the street up ahead, I can see cars crashing into each other and women crawling out the windows.  I make a hard right, running through people’s yards and jumping over fences through the neighborhood.  A slight haze of confusion begins to reside over me.  My senses seem to be heightened.  I can taste the odor Este Lauder and Chanel following close behind me.  I make it to the main road and see Panera Bread looming in the far off distance, in what looks like a scene of total apocalyptic destruction.  To avoid the calamity that lies ahead, I turn in the opposite direction and head north.  I immediately trip over myself and come crashing on to my face.  As I scurry to get up, I see that my arms are covered in thick, dark hair.  Unable to make it onto my feet, I begin running on all four. . seemingly faster than I have ever ran on just two limbs.  My speed and agility are unmatched.  I feel the distance grow between me and the mob behind me as I make my escape across a large empty field and then enter into wilderness.  With no real sense of purpose or direction in this strange new place, I am alone.*UPDATE:  Three months have now passed and I have never felt so free.  It seems I have made two new friends.  Things are going well."
Please dont buy! This stuff doesn't work.  I put this next to my speakers and it didnt do anything.  I even turned my radio up as loud as it could go.  I even put it in a toaster like the Ghostbusters did with the pink slime and still nothing.  All I got was a ticket for disturbing the peace for being too loud.  Radioactive my butt!!
"I'll take this as an improvement of sorts.  Silly as this stuff is, it's far less damaging than organized religion.  It's embarrassing now, but as a teenager I was interested in ""magik"".  I read thousands of pages of Aleister Crowley and even that fake ""Necronomicon"" that used to circulate.  So esoteric.  So cool.  The kids will wise up eventually.  Even if they don't, I'll take goddess worshipers, Tarot readers and other occultists over monotheists any day.  ""Harm ye none, do what ye will"" is far more congenial than the bloody-mindedness of the Bible or Qur'an."

"http://afrocityblog. files. wordpress. com/2009/04/black-man-tea-party. jpgmaybe if you had socialism people would be able to put their apostrophe in the right place. As someone from outside the US it is just absolutely alien that people are on the streets with placards complaining about ""socialism"" especially when you see the exact people who are the ones protesting.  I was in the US recently and I took a cab in St Louis, the cab driver was an older American who had bad health little or no healthcare as I understood it but he spent the entire journey complaining about socialism.  As a Swede/Brit/European my head just cannot get around the concept of someone whose life would be orders of magnitude better complaining about socialist beliefs.  The ruling classes have through a very cunning media campaign managed to dupe the working classes."

"It's sad that low-information liberals don't get the idea that stand your ground is the means for poor people to protect themselves from others attempting to bully them.

Having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall (figuratively) in the face of a threat.   If the situation between the black young man and a Hispanic guy were switched, and the hispanic was driving the black guy's head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage, the vast majority of America would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life.

"Ever since September 11, 2001, due to the draconian security measures imposed by the TSA, I have been unable to enjoy fresh, sliced bananas while cruising at altitude on commercial airlines. Since the Hutzler 571 has no sharp edges, I can now safely take it through airport security without fear of it being confiscated or my person being searched. And that's a good thing, because I don't think a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer would comfortably fit where I'd need to hide it from the TSA.My child is also now able to enjoy fresh, sliced bananas in school since the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is compliant with school rules forbidding anything that resembles a knife (including drawings of knives) anywhere within 1000 feet of the school campus."

""Your joking right?   That debt is largely a legacy of the last president and his two wars, which we had to continue.   Conservative fiscal ideas are what drove us over the edge.

"I bought this shirt because of the reviews it has received and I wanted to see what the magic would do for me. It just  happened to arrive the day before I was going to go camping, so I decided to set aside for the next day.The next day, I wore the shirt and my favorites pair of jeans. When I finally arrived at the calm grounds, I unpacked the car and head out on the trails with my backpack and a water bottle that stays cold for 24 hours filled with Tuscan Whole Milk.I finally found  the perfect spot and set up camp. I went to go find some wood for a fire and before long I was lost. Unluckily, I didn't have my map or my compass on me.I wondered until a heard a voice call my name. I turned around and standing no further than five feet away was an old bearded man. I asked him how he knew my name, but he said that wasn't important. He asked me if I knew why the shirt  possessed such great powers, I told him that I did not know. He then began to tell an elaborate story of the three wolf moon shirt.He claimed that the first wolf, the one on the top left was the bravest wolf in the world, there was nothing he would not do to help his pack. He nearly has died hundreds of times doing things for the better of the pack. wolves would not be what they are today if it weren't for him.The second wolf was the wisest wolf in the world, for she knew anything and everything. Almost every wolf in the world has came to her at one point in their life to ask for knowledge. wolves would also not be what they were today if it weren't for her.The third wolf, the one on the right was the worst wolf in the world. He has harmed many wolves and is feared by all wolves. He had caused the most destruction out of all wolves combined, yet wolves would not be what they are today without him.The three wolves have all shaped the community of wolves to be the way it is today. Wolves would not exist without these three wolves. They are all almost completely different, yet they all have one thing in common, they howl at the moon. Every wolf does this and it is how they survive.When the man finished his story he told me how to get back to my camp. I thanked him and started walking back to my camp. When I turned my head to see if he was still there, all I saw was three wolves head into the bushes.When I returned to my camp I decided that I'd just have some cut up banana and go to bed. That night I awoke heard howling outside my tent, I would have peeked outside if I wasn't so tired. I'll never forget that day as long as I live, the shirt changed me for the better, and odds are it will change yours too."

Imagine my frustration when I tried to use it and nothing. IT JUST SAT THERE ON THE COUNTER!!  After about a week, I finally gave up on it. Meanwhile, MY BANANA TURNED BROWN.

"This milk is fantastic, white, and comes in a recyclable plastic container.  If you store it in the fridge, then you can have it cold... if you leave it out of the fridge (which I don't recommend) then you will get an interesting smelling but liquidy beverage to share with friends and family.  The great thing about this milk is that it is delivered to your door, usually by the UPS guy.  I did have to knock it down one star because of the price, $45 for a gallon of milk is almost what we pay for gasoline, and that just is a little high, but considering you don't have to go to the market, then you have an added bonus there.  I know others have said the same thing about this product, but overall I think milk does a body good.

"Without culture, and the relative freedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future. -- Albert CamusOnly a creation such as the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer could persuade me to renounce all of modern biology and become a Lamarckian. Long have primates that coexist with us--as well as the troglodytes and ancestral species that came before-- battled the indomitable dread banana. Now, the beastly fruit bested by a simple but elegant plastic form?  Incontrovertible evidence, I say, that no less than the ultimate GOAL OF EVOLUTION itself could have devised such a form.I remember the conflict within me as I tore and scratched furiously at the shipping box that contained my Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. It was euphoria, mania, disbelief, and a seventh glass of scotch. Finally, it was hunger for victory, for justice, for food that overcame me as I staggered to the kitchen clutching the bane of bananas. There before me was my taciturn foe, spotted black and sinister, its very aura curled the veneer from my kitchen counter.  The Hutzler reassured me though, and I fought tears as I beheld its triumphant yellow color, its provocative stem, its blades that forshadowed the ruin of any banana underneath them.Was that a tremble of my hand or the fruit as I peeled it? Even in my best of dispositions my motor skills were woefully lacking, constantly disappointing.  At the moment of truth, would I fumble or balk?  Would I be forced to resort to duct tape or some glue to steady my grip? I leveled the Hutzler with trepidation for what may have been an hour, studying the sharpness of the plastic blades, twisting it gently to test its durability, and then finally raising it high above my head.  With a shout I swung both fists down and the Hutzler fell with them to a sickening ""thwack!"" on the counter.  Then, dazed, I rubbed the sting from my knuckles and looked.  The banana lay utterly segmented and slain.  I raised a slice to my lips but before I could taste the victory, I noticed a trickle of red from my nose and darkness took me for a fortnight.Since then, I have sliced other bananas more quickly and with fewer blackouts, which I fully acknowledge as no fault of this wonderful device.  Perhaps it takes a better man than I to wield such a mighty appliance, but I have gratefully washed my Hutzler after every use and display it under glass in my foyer, preserving it for the day it may pass to my firstborn, and his firstborn. Fie on the pretenders that have copied the Hutzler and charge higher for it.The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer is truly a gift to the future, both of the jungle that is human society and of the equatorial jungle, teeming with those languid, defeated, yellow fruits."
"Having gone through many flashlight batteries over the years, I thought I'd try this out by rubbing it on my face before going out at night. A few skin graphs later, I see this wasn't the best idea."
"Christians can't be Republicans either, but you don't see that affecting them.   Jesus was all about helping the poor, giving out free healthcare, and kicking the moneychangers out of the temple.   He was also pretty cool with taxes, very anti-war, and non-judgemental.   Doesn't seem to stop Christians any from supporting the political party that's completely Anti-Jesus."
"Of course this is only an issue in Republican states.  When Michigan passed its voter ID law, not a single democrat came here ranting and raving some bullshit about racism."
"I bought this because I was the leading bid on an eBay auction for a lightly used 1982 Delorean DMC-12 that needed new tires. Sadly, I was outbid at the last .000007th second. By a nickel. I gotta hand it to whoever did that- they got one hell of a lucky break.Anyways, shipping was fast. The UPS guy seemed to be in a serious hurry to get it delivered and away from himself. Not sure why. Since it wasn't particularly expensive, I decided to put it away for a rainy day. I made the mistake, however, of putting it in my bathroom storage closet. At some point the label must have fallen off, hence the lack of a full 5-star rating- poor build quality applies to adhesives as much as anything else.About a week later, my teenage son ran out of Axe hair gel and saw the unmarked tin in the closet. He grabbed it, slathered some in his hair, and went on his date. I'm guessing the girl really liked his hair, because he came back all smiles and aglow with self-confidence. However, it seems like he's either been using too much of it in his hair or it's not washing out, because his hair seems to be sticking up vertically all the time- even when wet. And there's an odd sheen, as well- it seems like every time he gets mad, the sunlight hits it and makes his hair look like it's glowing yellow.I know it's a little odd, but he's not complaining. And it may just be a coincidence, but he's been putting on a lot of muscle mass lately. I don't know if maybe he's joined a gym or something, but his muscles are absolutely huge now! To be honest, I think his father is a little jealous of how fit he's gotten. But again, that's probably got nothing to do with the Uranium Ore, though. Like I said- just a coincidence. Either way, he's running low and needs some more for his hair, which has been growing very quickly since he began using it to style his hair. When I asked him how many he wanted me to order, he got very excited and replied ""Over 9,000!"""

If they had to deal with their neighbors in a fair and civilized way (as all the other countries in the world do), and in the absence of continuous US partial interference, they would be forced to reconcile and co-exist with them.  The US unconditional love and support in the long-run is doing Israelis more harm than good, not mentioning the rest of region."

"Let's get this out of the way up front.  This is a high-quality article of clothing.  There is a nanosecond in time before your skin comes into contact with this product where you're thinking ""Nah, probably too good to be true.""  In the next instant all doubt washes away as you sense the luxurious thickness of the cotton and you're drawn into a warm special place.  The same place that the smell of cookies baking in the oven takes you.  Where life is wonderful and all is right in the world.  It's a well made shirt, that's for sure.Of course, there are the other benefits of this product.  People...all sorts of people...will want to talk to you.  They will go out of their way to talk to you.  Many will ask up front about the shirt and its intrinsic benefits.  Others skirt around the issue all the while not really taking their eyes off its majestic beauty.  Have a fear of small talk?  Not anymore you don't.And then there's the ladies.  There are several stages of denial.  You will witness them all.  The first is the recognition that something is afoot.  You might get some inquisitive looks as if to say ""what is going on here?""  The next is the undeniable urge for them to understand what they are seeing as the shirt speaks to some part of her subconscious--reawakening some primal instinct long dormant.  I remember when my coworker first saw me in it.  She's a pretty chic and well dressed type.  She was wearing her Dolce sunglasses and a sun dress from Michael Kors with Steve Madden heels.  She looked great. I could see her features twitch as she took it all in.  ""No.  It can't be.  Yes...er...No...err...  Wow...""  Poor thing.  Never saw it coming.  She couldn't understand.Once they get up the courage to ask about it (see first paragraph) -- about the elephant (wolf?) in the room so to speak-- It's already too late.  She has been drawn into the clutches of seduction.  Thereafter never again the same.  Sometimes they believe they are the hunter, whilst unknowingly becoming the hunted.Listen, I could really go on for hours, and, well, a gentleman never tells.  Buy the shirt.  See what happens.  Just remember, this shirt is not something to be trifled with.  No will no longer mean yes.  Yes means yes."

"Finally, a pen I can lift without risking injury to my back.I have been on disability several times for long periods because I would get asked to take dictation. Frantically I would search for a laptop with the word processing software already open (because I dont know how to use a computer) but there were times when there were none available. My boss would look at me with those smoldering eyes, the sweet smell of scotch and stale cigarettes on his breath, and hand me a notepad and pen. At first it would  be fine, the words would slide easily from his mouth, to my hands and then down on to the paper in perfect form. Then, eying me up and down, he would begin speaking faster, move behind me, start stroking my hair in earnest, and my hand would be weighed down by the sheer mass of the man-pen, unable to keep up. I would endure the torture, fearful to speak out, unable to stop trembling at the caress of his hand against the back of my neck, moving down to unclasp my bra.Then my arm would give out and I would fall to the floor in agony, screaming to the gods who had abandoned me here for being born the wrong gender, a cruel joke.When i got word of these pens, the first thing I did after my most recent trip to the hospital / obgyn, was pick up a pack of these. I have to say - game changer. No longer do i have problem taking dictation for hours and hours on end, sometimes all through the night. I feel so good now I am even able to pick up the tray from room service to have breakfast in bed ready for him.My husband is somewhat disgruntled with my new work hours, but he understands how important this job at the wal-mart is to me, and how important it is to be a liberal woman with a job of her own. He doesnt understand why he has to pick me up from motels in the mornings to go home to shower before driving me back to work. I try and explain but I don't think I'm doing very well, its probably because I'm a woman and i just don't have the mental facilities to convey what its like to work for a great place like wal-mart and the kind of things they demand of their employees.Anyway - buy these pens for your wives and daughters!"

"I have to say, I can't possibly think of a better use of one's intelligence than the creation of the 571B Nana Slicing device. Why on earth would anybody which to contribute to medical advances, or bridge he gap between nations whom have been at war for decades when you could spend the time creating this splendid product?  It is a far superior design to that of the wire item that was created circa the 1960s to slice eggs using the same principle. As of course plastic is a far more sustainable and recyclable production substrate.  I would be completely unable to go about my daily life bereft of this product as I don't appear to have any ability to apply myself enough to think of an alternative kitchen utensil to slice a banana!"

"Cruise about and see the hottest, sexiest styles on LuLu's, PinkIce and GoJane, then bust ass back to Amazon to catch the vibe of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.  At first, this item is eye-candy, a monochromatic ectasy of Italian design.  The gently rounded lines and the cute red accent on the top is classic and hip. Right out of the FedEx box, it is cool and inviting. But, like many quick shop decisions, this one proven to fall flat after purchase. At first, the fluid design was appealing, but after just one washing, the product was limp and lifeless.  I could not fold it or get it on a hanger.  Even the slightest touch of fabric softener changed the entire personality of this item.  Ironing is out of the question.  I soured on this purchase very quickly. Add to the fact there is no color choice, size is limited and some socially conscious issues floating around about genetic enhancement, I would have second thoughts about purchase.  One star."

"I was very unhappy with the BIC for Her line. The pen abruptly stopped putting out...ink. This was followed by an excessive weight gain.

"YEaH!  About time!  Thees pens r super nice and good fer women.  I wuz gettin' sick of all my lady friends taking my pens from me.  It was pretty bad - I was having to hide my pens in my tackle box, truck - and even cut the top of one of my beer cans to diskiz the fact that I had pens!  It wuz gettin so desperate, I even had to buy some ammo tape and make my pens too manly for my daughter and wife to think about using.  Whew... what a hassle that was.Anyhow - now that we have penz just fer ladies - my problems are all solved.I hope they make T-Shirts just for ladiEes too."

"I have found, through much trial and error, that one cup of Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz to  two cups of Uranium Ore, one cup of Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3), and one Emu Egg makes for amazing, light, fluffy pancakes. Whats more, not only do they taste delicious, they are easily found in a darkened room due to their pleasing unearthly green glow. Your kids will love them, and better yet, they can be used for a valuable lesson in financial management! The repeated tooth loss that rapidly follows can be used to teach your children about money management due to the windfall they will realize due to repeated visits from the Tooth Fairy. Trust me, no family should be without these fine products. Alone they are valuable in and of themselves. Combined, you will positively glow with the quantum leap your taste buds will experience as they transition into a new state of scintillation that does not decay."

"Ever since I was but a wee child stuffing my face with banana slices, smearing them on the wood floors, in the carpets, all over my diapers, and the cat, I have LOVED bananas.  You could say sliced bananas were my favorite foods... were.Then me mother, bless her sole, was horribly maimed in a freak banana slicing fighting with an estranged aunt. I won't go too deeply into this, but to make a short story shorter, mama was no longer able to slice my bananas for me. And here I was a 38 year old man-child with no experience at all with slicing said bananas.What was I to do?I tried mashing them up. No good.I tried eating them like a monkey. But I AM NOT A MONKEY! I'm not.So I got off the couch.I went to the kitchen.  I knew where that was because the Captain Crunch lives there.I found the knives.  I started cutting. I cut for weeks through pain and tears, and a lot of madness. A LOT of madness. Things did not work out like they should have. Sure, I cut some bananas.  No, they werent neat cuts. There was blood. There were body parts.Later, there was therapy.I came to accept my losses. I came to accept the fact that yes, I am a man. I man with nine fingers and one thumb.Cursed knives. But I am a Buddhist now. No attachment and all that.I gave up sliced bananas.That was a lifetime ago.That WAS my story.Then came the Hutzler 571.Life changed. My sliced bananas are back. I feel different. Alive. Like get a tattoo alive. Like dance or something alive.Thank you Hutzler.(Typed on a voice activated keyboard)"

"The Banana Slicer appears to be the greatest invention since sliced bread.  However, it has made my life miserable... What used to take a few moments (slicing a banana), now takes a great deal of time.  It used to be easy to peel a banana- so easy that monkeys could do it.  Now, I have to peel each and every slice once I slice the banana.  It used to be easy to toss the banana peel and watch people slip and slide.  These little peel slices are just not as effective for slipping and sliding. Now comedians are losing their jobs and being forced to take welfare.  This is adding to our growing government debt.  Politicians are debating for days now on what to do with the lack of whole banana peels.  It is just not as fun to walk any more, causing an increase in riding automobiles.  This is leading to a dramatic increase in global warming and asteroids coming close to the earth.  Zombies are rising.  Vampires are becoming all too common (I see them daily on Buffy.) All for the lack of instructions on how to properly peel and slice your banana.Besides, my hand gets all messy by placing a banana in the slicer, and pushing the banana down against the blades.  Nothing is worse than mushed banana on your hands... Except zombies, vampires, globing warming, the growing debt, asteroids, death blizzards, Yellowstone blowing its top, government conspiracies, lack of guns to protect against the growing banana revolt, killer SUVs, sequester releasing thousands of killer bananas from prisons..........."

"There was a time in my life, where the world was filled with beauty.I could watch the birds sing, the deer play, and the sun set behind the foggy mountainside, and smile with tears in my eyes, because I knew that there was someone up above that was looking out for us all. Someone who created this perfect enigma, and the motivation for us to solve it.That all changed in the summer of 1989.In the summer of '89, I was with some friends at the Big Brutus steam shovel in Oklahoma, just enjoying the sights. But I didn't pack a lunch. My friend, Martin, offered to share his with me. He handed me a banana. I had never seen this waxy fruit before, and was curious to see what secrets lay beyond it's peel. Just then, I realized that I had no idea as to how to expose it's core. Ashamed of being so sheltered and clueless, I decided not to ask my friends for help. Instead I placed the banana in my pocket, and excused myself to the bathroom. Instead I went to the shovel of old Brutus. I scanned all around to make sure no one was watching, and attempted to open Pandora's Box. Needless to say, I failed. Was covered in some sort of banana paste. Hungry, and disappointed, I wiped the evidence clean, and returned to my friends.Years passed, and I held my head in shame. Meaning had been removed from my life completely. I was not living anymore as a mortal, but as an ethereal being, that simply roamed the earth with no direction or hope.In my small apartment, I had Banana Weekly scattered all around the floor and table, as well as a catalogue I had created of monkeys eating this fabled fruit. They made it look so easy.Yet I was alone in the world, and unable to achieve my goal in life. I invited no one to my apartment, because I was so ashamed of my obsession.I decided that my life needed changed, so I went to college.After college, I was sitting in a cafe in Louisville, when I saw a post on a bulletin board, saying that there was a crew of Conservationists from Disney, who were looking for able bodied chaps, to help gather information on the rainforests, in order to remake The Jungle Book.I applied and was taken to the jungles.Throughout my day with the team, I would do my daily tasks that were asked of me, but by night, I would sneak off to try and find banana trees.One night, I wandered a bit too far from camp, and was lost. (but was I?) As the sun began to rise, and panic sank in, I fell to my knees in tears. A native approached me, and began to speak, in a tongue I didn't recognize. He then drew a picture in the sand with a stick. It was a banana. I jumped up with excitement, saying ""Yes! Yes! Banana!"". The native smiled, then led me away to a temple on the mountains, covered by foliage and jungle, that looked as though no man had set foot in for thousands of years. I was introduced to the clans leader, Zeo. He promised to train me in the fabled art of Bananatry, as long as I proved myself to be a noble warrior.I spent 3 years, in various conflicts and clan wars, claiming lands for the clan, and stopping foreign influence in the area.On the night of my initiation, I was dressed in bright feathers, and given a tattoo of this:The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.I knew exactly what to do. I returned to the United States, and was introduced to this new internet phenomenon that was created in my absence within the jungle, and hopped on Amazon.com, where I ordered this divine tool.My life now has meaning. I understand that bananatry is an art; to study and master it, is not a right, it's a privilege.Thanks Hutzler, for helping people master this art since the dawning of time!"

I had alwaya felt so dirty using men's pens, I was living a handwriting lie.But then I caught my boyfriend using them, he tried tellong me it was just a mistake, but I always thought he was keeping a secret from me, and now I guess it's out, he was either previously a woman, or identifies himself as one.I'm now eagerly awaiting Bic's release of Tampons, for Him."
"I used to only use very manly uni-ball pens in black and blue and found myself becoming more manly to the point I had started dating other women. The freedom to write my own cheques and prepare a balanced household budget had unbalance my inner feminine ways and alas there was no helping me until BIC Cristal for Her Ball Pens came along! Soon after finding this revolutionary product my inner femininity returned! I no longer felt inclined to maintain a paying position, read or write items other than grocery lists and was able to relinquish control of my finances to my father. Thanks to BIC I have now met the man of my dreams to complete all of my daily thinking tasks which has increased my time to watch soap operas, file my nails and complete the celebrity crosswords in Cosmo. Thanks BIC!!"

"The Hutzler 571 banana slicer saved my life. I've had high blood pressure for years, and my dr informed me that eating bananas will help lower my blood pressure because they contain potassium. I could never figure out how to eat the bananas and continuously tried stuffing them down my throat whole. This ended with multiple trips to the emergency room, weird looks when the banana entered my gaping wet mouth, and a hernia from dry heaving. Then I stumbled upon the 571 and my life has never been the same. My Bp is now well below dangerous levels because I can cut my bananas into small pieces to eat. I now have bananas with every meal.. Bananas and bacon, bananas and salt, bananas and soy sauce, bananas and A1 steak sauce.My only suggestion is to make the next model laser guided as I sometimes have problems lining up the banana to fit in the 571. If I had laser guidance, this wouldn't happen. I miss probably 1/10 bananas."

I await the publication date with eager anticipation, and my credit card at the ready."
"I am very dissatisfied with this purchase due to the fact that this was about 3 sizes too small.I received this shirt for Christmas from my 83 year old mother who thinks that I need to add more ""color to my wardrobe"". She says she purchased it in a smaller size to encourage me to lose a few, even though my full figure isn't shameful with the ladies (if you know what I mean).I'm sure this will be a great shirt to wear on those days when you just want to relax and open up a bag of cool ranch Doritos and watch soap operas with my mom.But to be more clear about the positives and negatives with the shirt, I loved the biggest wolve for it reminds me of my aunt Bertha when she didn't shave who always used to buy me Magic cards (and still does) every birthday. But I do not like the color, neon orange would be a better fabric."
But-but the rapture!
"it's a college bake sale, let's be fair now.  asians would pay 2. 50"
I'm going to use this comment without giving credit to you.
"Standard stuff here, nothing new.   Same old flawed foundations supporting poor arguments.   He ""owns"" himself, so he is somehow self-sovereign and all humans ought to respect that asking nothing in return.   So he has a right to what he gets and no obligation to give in return.   Standard libertarian nonsense."
"Funny, we're in the same category as Canada, western Europe, Australia, and Japan despite the constant comparisons to them."
"I've been trying to use these pens, but I just couldn't do it. I had to find some guy to help me learn how to use them.These pens are not ""for her"".I give 5 stars for the pretty colors."

"These pens are very nice. At first glance one might think they are dull stick pens, but truly they have a nice personality and a great sense of humor. One thing concerns me, though: the inclusion of the blue pen. Am I being too fussy? Maybe I am. But that blue pen is causing me to ask some uncomfortable questions about myself."
"That, of course, is the Debt Star."
It wants to keep the drug companies healthy.   Why cure when you can treat with medicine for the rest of ones life and get revenue all along the way.   That teamed with the bureaucracy and snails pace of advances sums it up.
"It's not even all that miraculous, the chalk dropping on his clothes and then rolling away is well within the realm of possibility.  If the chalk floated down to the floor like a feather or hovered in mid-air then we'd have something."

"I remain disappointed that my new H-571 did not come with Wi-Fi.  Also, its GPS function is apparently disabled, which means I can find neither the H-571 nor myself when either one of is lost.  On the plus side, it slices bananas with great efficiency.  I have now sliced some 3,255 bananas, and they are rotting in a pile on the west side of my kitchen.  If anyone would like to come over and help me cook a truly vast amount of banana bread, I'd appreciate it."
"If they cared about debt, they wouldn't have voted for a candidate that wanted to increase military spending by $3trillion."
"Be sure you read the fine print -- the picture is not an accurate representation of this product.Mine arrived in a cow, ""some assembly required."" On the plus side, I have to admit it WAS pretty fresh."
"The shirt fits me, and my wolf dog.  We wore it for the last blood moon and felt the power.So far the only thing that the 3 wolf moon shirt has failed to deliver is an economical experience.  If I had more time and skill, I could make my own, but for now, I'll have to pay these premium prices.Happy Hunting"
I'm so happy he's been given enough rope to hang himself.
"I had been contemplating buying this shirt for 5 years; I had heard rumors of its powers and admit that I was curious. A co-worker purchased the shirt last month and told me her life was forever changed. When my shirt arrived, I studied the box for about 3 hours before I had the courage to open it. To my surprise, as I reached to open the box, the shirt levitated from the box and collapsed in my hands. It was as if it were telling me everything was how it was supposed to be. I put the t-shirt on and it fit like a glove! It made me look and feel glorious, it practically glowed with perfection! I felt my senses heighten and my mind clear. I could hear and smell everything around me and immediately felt kindred with my Australian shepherd. Suffice to say, I haven't taken the shirt off since and I keep attracting admiring glances from my co-workers, friends and strangers. They too feel the power!"

"When I bought this product, I was anticipating fast and effective banana slicing.  But no...it took me 45 minutes until I gave up looking for a power cord!  Then I tried to install AAA batteries, AA batteries, even XZ batteries - and guess what?  The device is not compatible!  I even unbent two paperclips, tied a wire to each one of them and sticked them into the electric outlet.  Apparently the device is not capable of handling 110V (unlike me).I am not about to give up after a sleepless night.  Would any fellow reviewer from Europe be willing to pay a shipping charge so I can send it to you and you can try it under 220V? Otherwise I will have to admit the defeat :("

"This product lives up to the promise of quick, uniform banana slices.  For that alone, I would have given it a five-star rating.  However, at roughly $2.50 per unit,it can become very expensive when attempting to slice an entire bunch of bananas.  Sure... the product is dishwasher safe.  But, the average dishwasher cycle is 90 minutes, and it can take up to a full day to slice an entire bunch of bananas, with the washing in between.I got smart [or so I thought], and bought six additional slicers.  To my dismay, I discovered that there is apparently no standardization in the banana-bunching process.  On my first trip home from the grocery store, I was excited to put my seven slicers to good use... only to find that the bunch of bananas I purchased had eight bananas instead of seven.  Again, a 90 minute wait until I could slice the last banana... and, by then, the others had started turning brown.  :(Hutzler: I would consider changing my 3 star rating to five if you were to acknowledge the aforementioned problems in the ad.  And, perhaps you could make good by selling them in a customizable quanitity pack to mitigate the banana bunching standardization issue."
"It came just in time one day as I was stuck on a particular philosophical quandary.  I opened up the package and lo and behold -- the jug was empty. Revelation replaced agitation. The milk wasn't there. Perhaps, it was never there to begin with. And thus, is the true nature of reality.My brain and 82 page thesis paper would like to thank the good people of Tuscan and Amazon for providing me with the catalyst for great intellectual discovery."
"Because the House cannot vote on a bill unless the Speaker allows it, and Boehner and his compatriots have been planning this shutdown all year long.   Why would they allow such a vote to take place until the country can be sufficiently damaged and he can start pointing fingers everywhere else?"

"Yeah, Fuck freedom of religion!  Free healthcare, my employer, that I **chose** to work for, is forced to pay for, is more important than that!"
"I don't know if its the pen or my mirrors at home! Either way, order these pens one size up as they tend to run small."
"When I was young my Mom used to make my brother and I banana and butter sandwiches. I always thought that Mom liked Robert best. I noticed that Robert always got the thicker banana pieces on his sandwich. I complained and complained to no avail. My brother was bigger than me. One day out of friustration I tried to steal a piece of banana out of his sandwich because I really thought I was owed it. His slices were an inch thick, mine were a half inch at best. He saw me and punched me in the chest. I reacted by stabbing him in the neck with the knife Mom had sliced the banana with. He nearly bled to death and still has an ugly scar. This could all have been avoided if we would have had the banana slicer. To this day I hate bananas."
"I consider myself somewhat of an international gourmet. I love using smaller Asian, and larger African bananas to make desserts for my partner of several years. Cutting the larger African bananas was giving me carpal tunnel and putting a damper on my our extra-curricular activities.  I bought this product hoping it would help me but alas it was too small to cut my girthier African bananas.  I tried putting the bananas in cold water to shrink them but sadly it didn't work.  I wish they sold this in an XL version to fit bigger bananas. I would also like to say they should have a smaller version for asian bananas, the normal ""European"" version cuts the slices too big.  In short if your happy with a normal sized banana this product is fine.  I prefer different sized ones."
"The ironic thing about Christie is that liberals like him because he is nice to Obama, and conservatives hate him for the same reason."
"Finally! Is what I thought when I first spotted these suitably feminine pens. A pen for all my womanly needs. However upon writing I have found my self spontaneously and uncontrollably screaming ""waaaaaaaaahhhh bodyforrrm!"" I've now been fired from three jobs. Thanks Bic. Thanks a bunch."
huh .  A democrat made a comment trivializing Rape and it's not all over the news?  If it was a Republican it'd be the top story on CNN and MSNBC right now.
"There is nothing better than whole milk, fresh from cows in the Tuscan region of Italy, so I placed an order for Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.  I blew it, though, by not paying extra for overnight shipping.My anxiety grew as the days turned into weeks and my Tuscan Whole Milk had not arrived.  Finally, on a baking-hot, summer day, the mailman delivered a rancid, exploded mess of white-hot curdles that I could smell coming from three blocks away.My Cap'n Crunch was not very good that night."

How could anyone not love such a compassionate and caring leader?"

"The joke is that there might be *more* innovative people.  After all, real genuises have tended not to be so interested in money as they are so overwhelmingly interested in their work.  Did Mozart or Einstein need a ton of money?  Did they cry about not having three swimming pools and multiple Porches?  What if we were actually closing off the very best talent or simply ignoring it?"
"Guys, I cannot stress this enough...read the recommended dosage. I was unprepared for the strength of Tuscan Milk. I always take my Viagra (TM) with a glass of milk. Unfortunately, I did not account for the catalystic properties of Tuscan Whole Milk. 28 days later, I still have an erection. Doctors are unable to treat it and they do not know when my amplified Viagra (TM) will wear off."
"This slicer was quite a disappointment.  I was so excited about having a way to slice my bananas, but all my bananas curve to the left and the banana slicer curves to the right.  So my banana slicer will sit in a drawer and gather dust.  :(((((("
"Great for keeping your chest and the upper parts of your arms warm. :) Also interesting design, however since showing my friends they all purchased this shirt also.

"There now lies the insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs - commerce surrounds it with her surf.  Circumambulate the city of a dreary Sabbath afternoon.  Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.  What do you see?-- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in milky reveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the Vhe bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster - tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?But look!  here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive.  Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they stand - miles of them. Leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues - north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?No.  It's Tuscan whole milk.  From Brooklyn."
My son is feminine but definitely not a woman and he does not want to be labelled a woman! I cannot recommend this product as I feel this product is sexist due to the fact there are no other identical versions for people without a vagina.
Wait until these fuckwits hear about the first amendment.
"As usual, I felt the slightest bit of trepidation towards the idea of ordering a pet over Amazon for my fie year old, Bartonothew. But, for the money Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon proved to be worth it.I wasn't sure if the weight listed was right, as 128 fl oz is perfect for Bartonothew. He's been very sick since birth with shingles and the thorpe so I was worried it would arrive and simply be too big to play with my little boy. But thank goodness, the weight was right on the money. I checked.Overall Tuscan Whole Milk is very patient, though as messy as you'd expect a new pet to be. It never lashed out at Baronothew, no matter what he does. It's almost impossibly quiet, as I don't think I'e ever heard it bark. Training Tuscan Whole Milk to do tricks, though, has proven impossible. I think my batch may have been born deaf. And again, it tends to make quite a mess when given to a five year old.4/5, would buy again."
"The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer was supposed to be a Godsend. I had read so many excellent reviews, but I have to say, the device is far too limited to be used except by a professionally trained fruit chef. For a start, 75% of the time it is the wrong shape. Bananas may be curved in up to four different directions, left, right, upside-down-left and upside-down-right. So unless the banana you are attempting to work on is a right-pointing-right-side-up banana you are doomed. And what if you buy your bananas in bunches? If you are lucky enough to get home and find- whew!- They are the right shape, THEY WON""T FIT! I had to mash mine with a set of encyclopedias into a jelly before I could then push the lot through the Hutzler. A waste of time that could have been put towards feeding my fish, and now they are all dead, too. What is needed is a Hutzler 572 shaped like eleven joined bananas. Four of these in a set, presenting all possible directional alignments. Also, if the Hutzler company could include a jar of fishfood with every purchase, that would be a boon."
"I bought one for my transgendered friend and she claimed how happy she was to finally use a pen that understood her true gender.  She admitted that until this pen was introduced to our male-dominate pen society, she was often challenged in writing, in spite of the fact that she was born a man.  Now, with this pen she feels she can write again and with confidence because this pens fits her and satisfies her every writing need.  Thank you Bic."
"Those are very common attributes, you should be a proud American."
"Love this product, however, I'm refrained of using it on the field because it is too bright. Enemy snipers can detect it from far away and almost got hit at least twice while trying to prepare a mid-combat snack; are you thinking about launching a camouflage series? I'd love to see this product in woodland, 3-color desert or UCP. These would match the Tactical Banana cases I already own.Thanks and keep up the good work."
"Let me get this straight.....  So Steve Wynn starts a company, employs a bunch of people, lays some of them off and now he's no longer a job creator?   So that business would just magically exist and employ people if he hadn't started it?   I'm not saying that guys like him aren't greedy or assholes, but let's not be disingenuous here.   Regardless of whether or not they have altruistic intentions, guys like him still employ more people than if they hadn't started their companies to begin with. Wynn is a bad example for ""corporate greed"" as he is an example of someone who has actually built something from nothing.   He doesn't owe a single job to anyone.   He employs people to help him make money."
I like how the second poll doesn't give an option to blame congressional Democrats.
"&gt;In dentists’ and doctors’ offices, hearing aid centers and pain clinics, American health care is forging a lucrative alliance with American finance.  A growing number of health care professionals are urging patients to pay for treatment not covered by their insurance plans with credit cards and lines of credit that can be arranged quickly in the provider’s office.  The cards and loans, which were first marketed about a decade ago for cosmetic surgery and other elective procedures, are now proliferating among older Americans, who often face large out-of-pocket expenses for basic care that is not covered by Medicare or private insurance. American exceptionalism."

"This stuff is great!  I have a long commute to work and was looking for an economical way to heat breakfast durning the trip. I had a microwave on the front seat but the glass tray kept sliding around.  I put this in a cooler with food, shake it up a little and within a couple minutes, the food is nice and warm.  It works so well the food stays warm in my stomach and through my intestines.  My wife is happy too because she doesn't have to sit in the back seat anymore since I took the microwave out of the front, but we can't figure out how to turn off the heated seats, if its not one thing its another!"
It's 100% true!!! My wife left me cuz she said I spend money foolishly... But on the up side I won the 2 gallons in the divorce. Funny she didn't fight for them... She took the house and cars... Pffft.... As if I can't just go across town and get those things replaced.

I wear this to the Vegas Pool clubs, and let's just say I have 'double downed' on the amount of women that approach me.Thanks 3 Wolf Moon!"

"I read the reviews for this, and I must say, I was a bit skeptical.  I thought there were a group of cynics sarcastically expressing their opinions because of some internet fad.  I decided to overlook it and give it a try for my own subjective experience, devoid of any opinion of the mass.  As it turns out, it was snug, it was warm and cool simultaneously, and I could karate kick in it better than my Free Willy tee.  My mother always told me that you need to dress to impress, and I've never walked into a board meeting since without drawing gazes.  Though they are jealous, the Buddha says to share in their desire, so I bought tees for the whole executive branch.  They were speechless.  Everyone is speechless.  I don't get carded for cigarettes anymore, I have free reign over the tennis courts, and cops don't ask me if I have any weapons in the car.  I'm happy with my purchase, but it's almost too good.  So, four stars."
"Only OK for me. I tried it at Henri Bendel's NYC Flagship store, where they had a Buy one, get Titanium 50% Off promo. While I get all the hype this is getting, I've tried facial products with way better price/quality ratio than this. If you suffer from roseacea, and would like to reduce pinkish appearance on your skin before makeup I'd go for the Smashbox Photo Finish (available at Sephora) instead. This was WAY too green for me. I  didn't like the glow in dark feature as much as I thought I would, and I also got frustrated with having to peel my entire facial skin off after every use. But if you're really into going into deep, give it a go!"
"I can't say enough good things about the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. It has become THE tool to use in the ZA. Totally makes up for when we left the bag full of guns at Hershel's farm when it got overrun.For months when we were on the run, slicing bananas the old fashioned way was putting too much stress and strain on the group. Our regular knives were pulling double duty slicing bananas and walkers both. I cannot explain the mental anguish this caused everyone, in a world where slicing bananas has to take the backseat to walkers. Now we can slice our bananas with ease and joy. It's even replaced my Colt Python, as I just cannot be without it.I might as well admit here and now that this was the real reason for the decline in my marriage with Lori. She refused to use the H571, well, that sort of thing will break any marriage. With the help of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I've been able to move on.I do not know what I'd do without the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer."

Each wolf represents a different stage of out being:  awesomeness, professionalism and awesomeness. I can't recommend this shirt enough. It even helped me lose 14 pounds."

This shirt is a LIFE CHANGER...So I received this shirt around 11:00 on a Friday morning....And obviously being the unemployed rocker that I am I was home to recive it...I went into my trailer and ran past my mom who was in the recliner watching the price is right straight to my room and slipped it on.... Instantly the sun starting shining thru the walls and my body started taking shape of that of a Greek god... I couldn't believe it...I felt the only thing to do next was to hop in my Sweet ass 1987 Iroc Z and cruise the town for chicks...Right off the bat the lady at Auto zone was ready to howl at my moon. ..She mentioned something about using my dipstick to check HER oil.. whatever that means...So all in all I have ordered 14 of the same 3 Wolves Howling shirt so I can have this ripping body and wavy red hair everyday and the non stop attention from any female in an 8 block radius...I will be waiting for the 4 wolves shirt to hit the stores....
"Connoisseurs of fine milk often ask, ""Why is Tuscan Whole Milk so expensive? Is it the velvety texture, the lightly sweet lactose, the softened hue?"" I just smile, amused by the idea that Tuscan's value is defined by its physical components. The truth is something greater, more ethereal, and immeasurable. More than just letting our cows traipse freely across the grassy meadows. More than just their fibrous organic diet.Tuscan Whole Milk is all about relationships. Specifically, the relationship with the cow.We don't treat our cows as mere objects. We're not the type to hang out in barns after hours, filling our emotional voids with the first over-lipsticked heifer who winks at us. We don't confuse our passion with vulgar hunger. We're not dairy lizards on the prowl, looking for vacuous, weathered Bessies to swap cud and play hide-the-udder with.We take our time. We want to get to know the cow. Its passions, its dreams. Our commonalities.Maybe we'll start with dinner. A candle is lit, Mantovani strings play softly. I enter the stable in Versace overalls and masculine confidence. I have bruschetta with kalamata and roasted red pepper tapenade; she has a clump of orchard grass.We don't need each other's life story. We are two beings who just happened to intersect at the same time - we care about who we are now. There will be a lifetime for us to ask questions of each other. But for now, we consume ourselves in each other's gazes and swim in the light of our connection.We laugh. Oh, how we laugh.After we dissolve in the pleasure of each other's company, after we've talked and mooed about our dreams, our loves, the scars of our past heartbreaks, dark moments when we were tipped over by college pranksters - only then do I level my stare, gather my longing and courage, and ask the question that has hovered over the entire morning. A question that must be asked with grace and poise, cognizant of desire, yet protective of the vulnerability of the secret that passes between us:""Forgive me if this is too forward, but the stirrings of my heart beat in time to the cocking of the rooster, my pulse quickens with the movement of the tractor, and my intent is well-meant. My gentle bovine, my cherished, hooved friend... may I milk you?""And then, the moment. I place my stool beside her udder, as if I am laying a ceremonial carpet `neath a queen. I pat her side. It's all right, I'm saying. I'm beside you. Close your eyes, my pet, and dream of Kentucky bluegrass.I start gently, with a mild tug, a touch that says all that words cannot. But it can't be rushed, or forced into speed. I'm not some teenage jackhammer, and she's no automatic fountain. Gentle rolls, knowing caresses, speed and velocity only ramping up as it feels natural. My pace hastens, my heart sets it charges, my voice rises to sing with the celestial chorale.At long last, our forbidden dance reaches its pinnacle, its emotional summit! ""We're almost there!"" I exclaim! ""Love me!"" she... well, I'm pretty sure she's saying ""Love me"" in cowspeak, whatever that is. Then at last, long last, I hear the first drops in the bottom of the bucket. Then a quicker series of drops, then... oh, then! Streams of lactic gold, filling our coffers, gushing towards ecstasy until it nearly spills over the sides!It ends all too quickly, yet it feels complete. I roll over and chew on a hayseed. She stands there. Oh, the volumes of words she says by the stillest of movements. She doesn't have to be outlandish in her actions. She doesn't have to acknowledge anything. She knows. We know.So when people ask me, ""Why is Tuscan Whole Milk so expensive?"", I respond with a shaking head, a raised eyebrow, and return the question to them -""Have you ever really loved a cow?"""

"Having been raised by Peruvian gorillas after my parents died in a shipwreck in 1974, I think it's safe to say I know a thing or two about banana-slicing.  Or at least, I thought I did.You see, last Thursday I received the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer as a gift from my Uncle Lawrence. He knows that due to my upbringing, I've developed banana-PEELING skills far superior to most of my peers, but as we've all learned--many of us the hard way--banana SLICING is a whole different ballgame.  It's like comparing tee-ball to the major leagues, or a chicken nugget to Coq au vin.  In other words--good luck, buddy.The first thing you'll notice is that the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer looks remarkably like a banana (unlike the Hutzler 570, which was a purple dodecahedron.) The sleek new design really gives it that authentic ""banana feel,"" which is exactly what I'm looking for in a banana slicer. In fact, it looks so authentic I've almost eaten it by mistake four different times.  Whether you need your bananas sliced for cereal, smoothies, pancakes, or more cereal, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer will help you get the job done in a ""nanner-second""!I think one of the most intuitive features of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer (our tribe calls it the ""Hutz"" or ""The 571"" for short) is that, while it's small enough to fit in almost any standard three-car garage, it's big enough to tackle even the meatiest, most genetically modified steroid-banana.Bottom line:  If you're anything like me, you're a busy man or woman who eats dozens of bananas several times each day. The absolute LAST thing you have time for is opening drawers and fishing out knives.  The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer didn't just make my breakfast easier--it enriched my life beyond my wildest dreams.  I've become a better husband, father, and overall human being.  I can run faster, jump higher, and last longer in bed, and it's all thanks to the patented German engineering of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. If you're in the market for something that will do exactly the thing it says on the box and also turn your entire life around, look no further than the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer."
"The NSA can spy on the *future*!?   Okay, this *is* getting scary."
"This product description is somewhat misleading - what it should say is: ""slice your DOMESTIC banana with one quick motion."" Wild bananas are almost impossible to kill with one slice. For those of us who prefer a more exciting mealtime experience, it is standard practice to hunt down all of our food in the wild; mindless slaughter is the best seasoning, as they say. And for the truly adventurous, Musa Ferus (or Wild Banana) is one of Mother Nature's deadliest (albeit tastiest) prey. Typically, one must stake out a Wild Banana's watering hole for several days before one even catches a glimpse of this elusive foe. It is also necessary to dowse oneself liberally in coconut musk as this pungent odor has a strangely soothing effect on the banana's normally ferocious temperament. After a Wild Banana has been spotted, one launches the hidden peanut butter trap concealed in the reeds near the water's edge, and then immediately begins pelting the confused beast with peanuts and maraschino cherry bombs. Hopefully at this point the Banana will be disoriented enough for one to safely approach without fear of attack, however many hunters have died horribly painful and prolonged deaths after misjudging the Banana's level of distraction. It will usually take several well-placed slashes of one's chocolate syrup dipped machete (the syrup obviously acting as a numbing agent) before one's foe is vanquished, and even then it can sometimes muster hidden reservoirs of strength to flee back into the wild. The point is, do not venture out into the jungle armed only with a Hutzler 571 and expect to kill bananas left and right; banana hunting can be a fun and exciting hobby, however one should never risk one's life in the pursuit of adventure without first educating oneself on the proper methodology and weaponry."

"A couple months ago, our family was on the brink of falling apart. But then my dad bought my mom ""BIC Cristal For Her"" pens for her birthday. Ever since my mom started using BIC Cristal For Her pens to write her grocery lists, our whole family has been saved! She now always has a nice cold Budweiser waiting for my dad when he comes home exhausted from his hard day of providing for us. No longer does she forget to buy my sister the ingredients she needs for her bake sales so she can raise money for her dowry. And she always remembers to buy me my Hot Pockets after I come home starving from football practice. Score!Quote from my mom: ""Before I had BIC Cristal For Her pens, I was utterly at a loss in how to write my grocery lists. I used to use those ugly regular pens that my husband uses to do important things, and somehow, I would always end up with ink all over my face and blouse! But now, the words just flow from the pen to the paper. It's like I don't even have to think, which is great because I'm a woman and it's hard for us to use our small brains all the time. Thanks BIC!""You might wonder, if my mom is so thrilled with the BIC Cristal For Her pens, then why doesn't she just write this review herself? Well, the answer is because the idiots at Apple still haven't invented ""for her"" keyboards, and we're a family of Mac users."
"This shirt is the bee's knees! My grandmother asks to borrow it everyday. Every time I go to Wal-mart, Flea Market or my job at the local dump people follow me howling. It's like they feel one with me and the ferocious creatures of the night that I wear on my shirt. I look forward to next year when my job at the dump gives me a raise so I can purchase another version of this MILF magnet."
"I am going to start this by saying that I was once a skeptic. The ""idea"" of dawning a wolf shirt, in public areas, was at first quite the ground for objectionable repose. To me it seemed as if this simple collection of more than course and fibrous cotton would do little more that chafe and cause immediate irritation to my man parts.I was wrong.The very next weekend, I have to admit, I yielded to the 3 wolf + moon shirt. Why you ask? Why would a man of such a stoic and decisive disposition falter; Ill tell you why. It was then, during the usual rounds of weekend errands that an idea - no - a vision came floating before my eyes as palpable and visceral as the taste of asphalt to a meth-head. The vision was that of the great American dream where my wife and I sat upon our front deck watching the children play among the lawn with our golden retriever Fido. Fido was a good dog with a breezy and tender disposition. But I digress; You see Fido was more than a dog - he was a bald eagle. Being a bald eagle Fido knew things that simple humans did not and with certain lucidity. When Fido told me that those damn communists from across the lake had started a nuclear assault on my home there was little more I could do than watch the distress in his eyes as he pleaded for me to make a move in defending the family... Why I wondered. Why could I not become the hero that this great country wanted me to be? Upon asking myself this question I felt the unrelenting urge to grip my own heart in my fist and scream in pain! Upon placing my hand to my chest I noticed then (what I should have known all along) that there was no wolf shirt.The vision was clear. No wolf shirt = inability to stop nuclear assaults from the Russians. Nuff said. If not for yourself (which is ridiculous) then do it for your family. Do it... for Fido."
the only flaw is that it should come with a little carrying case so that you don't have to put it in your purse with all the old banana pieces on it.

"This banana slicer changed my life. I used to wake up in despair and confusion about how to cut my bananas. Each morning I tried a new method, and each day I lost hope.

You saved me and made me a believer."
"I gave the shirt a four star rating simply because of the size issue of the shirt. I’m normally a tiny guy, aside from my height issues my arms are also usually as big around as a golf ball, but after wearing this shirt for as little as four days I was beginning to see the difference in how much more masculine it was making me. By week two I had to hang the small and move up to a large. While I’m thankful that I’m no longer called noodle arms it was a hassle to have to order a new large and go four days without a 3WM shirt. On the plus side, I now have a 3WM tank top due to the sleeves ripping from my arms.To see all of the awesome pictures I have of me and my 3WM shirt add me on Pinterest under rangerjon. Yes I know Pinterest is a very feminine thing, but thanks to all the extra testosterone I’ve received from this shirt I feel having a Pinterest account levels some of that out.I don’t ever take off the shirt after purchasing my new large. It helps the days at work go by faster, and I never have to shower because it gives me the natural scent of a wolf which the females dig! In fact I bought this shirt as a last attempt of having a normal life. I never really had the best of luck with women, but after receiving it I wore it on a first date with this woman at the local McDonalds located inside our Walmart supermarket. After 3 hours I was lucky enough to make this woman my wife!P.S. Every Duke game I have gone to they win, I’m not saying it’s because of this shirt, but I know that it plays a major role! Go Blue Devils!"
"I was very disappointed with these pens. Both the title and the description are very misleading. These are not encrusted with real diamonds, nor are they made of ""cristal"" - which I can only assume is a more luxurious form of common crystal. Also, the barrel and cap are both sheer. What are you suggesting, BIC? Is that meant to be some innuendo hinting that EVERYTHING for a woman needs to be sheer? How dare you! You wait until my husband hears about this, you scoundrel!And another thing, if these really are ""for her,"" why is the tiny BIC mascot on the front of the package male? Was the female character busy? Do you have any idea what my husband will say when he finds out that 2 times I was home alone with another man?! Are you trying to ruin my marriage and my reputation, BIC??"

"Chapter 1Once upon a time in a land far, far away known by many as Lady Orchard's classroom, sat Lady Orchard herself and 23 amazing students and a Chip. One rather snowy day as class was starting, Lady Orchard poured herself a nice large glass of 'Tuscan Whole Milk' (not the whole gallon now, she's not that crazy!) when something a little peculiar happened. Each sip she took, another one of her students was turned into a different mythical creature. One a dragon, one a unicorn, and etcetera. This worried Lady Orchard greatly, for King Nelson was going to survey the classrooms in just a few short hours. She tried everything to turn them back. She tried calling in Knight McCallum the wise to Witch McMillon. NOTHING WORKED!!!Chapter 2Lady Orchard was worried. She did not think she had actually taken 23 sips of the rather mad milk! Maybe her Zumba teacher could help her! She was a witch! She even used Cravendale milk to give her cats thumbs!!! She rushed over to her Zumba teachers hut to find her pinned down by all her kittens with thumbs! Lady Orchard was very confused on why her sweet kittens would do such a thing! Then she realized what Queen Lisa (The Zumba teacher) had nuzzled in between her arm and her side... Cravendale! The Cravendale was the key!!!Chapter 3Lady Orchard, who just realized she had left her class unattended, pried all the cats off of Queen Lisa. This task proved to be rather difficult since the cats had claws and thumbs. Once the task was done, Lady Orchard ran to the nearest by market to get her Cravendale, and quickly rushed back to her classroom. But alas, by the time she got there, King Nelson was standing furiously in the doorway. Once Lady Orchard got closer to her room, she realized that the animals had breed, and now there were four times as many mythical creatures as there were when she left!!! Before she explained to King Nelson what had happened, she drank the whole gallon (YES! This time the whole gallon!) of the Cravendale milk. Nothing happened.To Be Continued..."

"I gotta tell you guys-- when my parents got me these pens as an early Christmas present, I was a little skeptical.  At first I refused to use them, but after they took away every other option for writing utensils in the house, I was forced to relent.  And boy am I glad I did!  Using them has *literally* saved my soul, and turned me onto the righteous path.  You see (and I am ashamed to say it), for the last year and a half, I considered myself a transgendered man.But now everything has changed.  Where once I was confused, belligerent, and sinful, doggedly determined to follow Satan and his minions right into my own personal hell full of penises and privilege, now I am humbled by the glory of God in turning me back to his will and the flock of his followers.  Not only have I started growing my hair out again and wearing colors that coordinate with my pens (pink, purple, and new-growth green!), I have started going to church again, and learned the freedom that comes from a lifetime of equal work for almost-3/4-pay.  Boy was I wrong-- I was just pretending I wanted to be a boy.  Now that I'm back in my comfortable pencil skirts and high heels, flirting with white men who make twice my salary, I've found where I truly belong.And that is sitting at my kitchen table, using the pinkest Bic pen I can find to make a grocery list to feed my family.Thanks Bic!  You saved my life!"
"I like the pen and it makes me feel very feminine. Also I find that, because I'm a woman and inferior, I'm not very good at writing, so the extra confidence goes a long way. I'm even writing this tapping away on the keyboard with my two fave ones, Pink and Purple. Speaking of which, can I return the blue, green and red pens? They're not very feminine colors. Also, there was no crystal at all in the packaging, only plastic. And no carats at all. I think that might be fake advertising. That's why you're only getting 3 stars. Shiny things are very important to a woman, and I think you might be using this to lure us into liking you. Bad boys!"
"awoken one day after having a bad hangover I went to my cabinet and poured all of my cereal in a huge bowl, then i went into my refrigerator to find that my milk was gone....it made me angry, i couldn't even eat my Bootleg cereal.Since i have no Bodegas near me and the closest store is 43 miles down the road,i decided to buy a whole gallon thru Amazon and was quite surprised that when i ordered it, the milk man (god) came and hand delivered it to my stoop.i was a happy boy, but since i was dumbstruck of the quickness of the delivery , i didn't read the expiration date on the milk and was forced to drink all my stumpy bubbly milk with my Kabooms.i had explosive diarrhea for a month, but at least i had eaten.thank you milk man , where you are"

"This sleek metonymy for the human condition reifies the heartache of postmodern society even as it negates it. The Hutzler 571 enacts Bakhtin's heteroglossia as it displays in raw form the multiple voices at work inside every banana, proportional and interactive yet distinct and, often, mushy. It is also a device of profound deconstruction, delimiting the fragment-banana and challenging its integrative potential by denying its ability to be reassembled as a cohesive whole (its traces are also ineradicable). From a Freudian psychoanalytical perspective, it is an uncanny castration machine. Moreover, it encapsulates Marxist alienation of labor by eliminating the human element and pride of craftsmanship in banana slicing. The Hutzler 571 is, one could say, the sublime object of ideology. Zizek needs one ASAP (express shipping available). It has earned a place in the museum of consciousness."

"This milk holds a feverish place in my heart. Without this milk, I would have lost everything I have nothing. In the end, only Tuscan Milk will be there for me.It started one late evening in June. It wasn't hot, nor humid. Cool actually; a nice day. I was walking down an alley way. It wasn't dark, but everything was wrong. I've walked this path before, on my way home. But this time, out the corner of my eye I saw this jug of what appeared to be milk. I stopped and approached the milk jug. Suddenly behind me a giant cat appeared and was getting ready to attack. As I turned and looked at the the cat in horror, behind me this white flash appeared. I whipped around and nothing was there. As I turned back around to look at the cat again, all that was left in the place of the cat was a jug of Tuscan milk. I ran to the jug and hugged it and took it home.To this day, Tuscan Milk is still here, spending most of its days in my fridge, protecting me from dangerous opportunities that might attack me.I'm so glad I met Tuscan Whole Milk on that fateful day in the alley."

"This slightly opaque whole milk opens with a fragrant black cherry and black raspberry bouquet with hints of menthol and vanilla. On the palate, this milk is medium bodied, well balanced, and satiny. The flavor profile is a tasty mild blackberry with notes of plum and dark chocolate. I also detected a dash of black pepper and a hint of oak as well. It was quite complex. The finish is dry and lingering. I would suggest pairing this gem with filet mignon."

"As you can understand, a Mom to seven children ages 5 months to 18 years doesn't have much time to slice bananas.  We go through about 17 pounds of bananas per day, because 1) they are as cheap as little debbie snack cakes but way more healthy and B) they look pretty in my kitchen and last longer than fresh flowers.  So anyway, because I have so many children, and am always looking for chores for them to do, this banana slicer came in super handy.  My 2 yr old uses the banana slicer to help me make baby food for the twins (5 months old.)  I was gonna buy one of those fancy smmancy baby food blenders to make mashed bananas, but this slicer was so much cheaper.  After the 2 yr old slices, I smash, and the twins eat!  The five yr old loves the slicer because she is obsessed with scissors and wants to cut everything; paper, her own hair...and recently she cut off all the blonde curls on her brother's head (the 2 yr old) so now she is only allowed to cut bananas with the slicer.  The 12 yr old uses the slicer and refuses to eat a banana the ""old fashioned way"" due to the fact that the slicer is ""way cooler than eating a banana like they did in the 90's"".....ok, that's a tween for you.  My 16 yr old is ADAMANT that he use the slicer before eating a banana because his older 18 yr old sister pointed out that he ""looked vulgar"" while eating his banana the other day, before we found this ingenious product.  So, he will only eat it if sliced by our new 571B.  And, my 18 yo daughter now uses the slicer to cut the banana for these smoothies she has been drinking every day.  She is on a new health kick, and would like to include the entire family in her new diet.  She really did surprise me though, when she pulled the slicer out of her pocket in the grocery store the other day.  We are unable to grocery shop without being stopped by 66 people who ask, ""Do you have two babies?""  ""Are they twins?""  ""Are ALL of these children yours?""  Well, one lady made the mistake of asking MY DAUGHTER if the twins were hers, and she yanked that 571B Banana Slicer out of her pocket and said, ""I oughta CUT you.""  So, thanks lady for inducing this new health kick on my 18 yr old daughter, she now thinks she's fat, because you thought the twins were hers.  And thanks for my 2 yr old constant repetition of ""you can't cut her she's a lady, not a banana....giggle, giggle"

"On the one hand, I am willing to give Tuscan Whole Milk 5 stars for the explosive diarrhea it gave me, which I quite enjoyed. However, the milk not only gave me diarrhea, it tasted like diarrhea, earning it only 1 star. So how many stars should I give it? Fortunately, I developed hepatitis, but as I am unsure at this point how severe my condition is, I remain neutral about the hepatitis. Thus, the most reasonable number I can give this product is 3 stars.I hope you find this review helpful."
"In soviet Russia, banana slice you. So every time I want eat banana, I have to fight to cut banana before it slice me. Now, with banana slicer, I can take down my bananas as easily as Putin takes down his political enemies."

"I have been looking for some new drink ideas for years and I truly believed that I had tried them all; water, coffee, orange juice, apple juice, other juice, other types of water, flavored coffee, ice coffee....you name it.  So imagine my surprise when I discovered Tuscan Whole Milk - thank you Amazon!  I guess it was the packaging that initially drew my attention to it.  Was the jug a gorgeous white or is this product actually that color?  Solving that mystery alone made this purchase a winner.  Spoiler Alert: THIS STUFF IS ACTUALLY WHITE!!!There were no directions on the packaging, so I was a little confused on how to properly use this product.  After searching online for hours I discovered that the red cap on top actually screws off of the jug counter-clockwise (who thinks of these things?) I carefully unsrewed the red cap, but immediately ran into my next quandry; what do I do now? Back to the internet(please Tuscan add some directions to the packaging or at least include a manual of some type).Turns out the cut out on the jug isn't simply decorative, it's actually a handle (great idea guys!).  While you cannot get both hands around the handle, believe me I tried, you can adequately control the jug by using 1 hand.  The jug is quite heavy and the opening fairly wide, so I would not suggest trying to drink directly from the jug, I have 3 velvet vests at the dry cleaners who can attest to this!  So I would recommend transferring the milk from the jug to some type of smaller receptacle.  I went with an empty glass that I was storing in my cabinet, if you don't have one of these check on Amazon under ""housewares"" and you can probably find one.Once transferring the milk to my glass, it was time for the taste test.  I sheepishly raised the glass to my lips and took a baby sip while holding my nose (I had no idea what to expect).  It was glorious!  I proceeded to drink the entire glass.  Long story short, this was a great purchase and I have been telling all of my friends about Tuscan Whole Milk.  It's so good I'm going to try to find other uses for this product other than simply drinking it.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated guys!Please be on the lookout for my video review of Tuscan Whole Milk.  I'm going to give my review, but also include some tips on how to work the red cap and handle.  It should be a real time-saver for everybody."
"Last year, the Hutz announced their second studio release was hitting the streets and I, like many fans of the 571, was stoked. On release day, I waited in a long line outside a Zooby Records all night next to a couple of yuppies who thought the lead singer's name was pronounced JaWANton. Rookie mistake, but they were nice enough. The pimply college kid who got roped into staffing the release unlocked the door seven minutes late, so by the time I hit the counter, the atmosphere was tense. I saw an old woman stab a young man with a stick. Just a basic stick. Wasn't even sharp. Well, ok, she just kinda jabbed the kid's skin a bit with it, but the intention was specifically stabby. The kid grimaced slightly; I remember that much.ANYWAY, $32.71 later, I had it: Hutzler 571's sophomore release, Banana Slicer.I shredded the plastic wrap open easily with my Benton 414 Plastic Dewrapper. It's quite an exceptional product and you should check it out. i'm all about products designed for very specific tasks and you'll find most of my reviews geared toward such devices. I have a collection.ANYWAY, this album was nothing like their debut. It was like Jawanton doesn't even care anymore. Like, the first track, ""Plantain 9 From Outer Space"" was decent enough, but Pierce Gap's basslines on ""Come On Peel The Noise"" and ""Brotassium"" were sluggish as all hell. I mean, granted. It's still THE HUTZ, you know? It's not gonna be absolute swill. Yoon's bousouki work is still to die for, and Kite Man's beat machine sounds loud and well-serviced.So if you're a die hard 571er, you're gonna need to get it, but if you're just a casual fan looking for a repeat of '09's ""Slippery When Stepped Upon,"" look elsewhere."

"The point of the article is that while everyone (outside of the Fox bubble) understands that it is an astro-turf group funded by billionaires, many progressives see tea-party supporters as uninformed, low income fools who are working against their own best interest.   While the reality is that the majority of tea-party supporters are the same wealthy conservatives that have been around since the Reagan revolution.   This is not to say that the media hasn't focused on the image of the ignorant white-trash supporter with a severe spelling dysfunction."

"Before I found the 571, I used to put the entire, whole banana on my Corn Flakes. I did not like it!  The corn flakes would accumulate in the bottom of my mouth while at the same time I was chewing on my banana.  You can imagine the glances I would get in hotel lobbies and morning business meetings.  Now I do not leave home without my 571 slicer.  I love it! On a golf course and wanting a banana? No problem.  Just whip it out and ""presto."" Instant sliced potassium.  Driving in the car, who cares?  Slices right on your leg during traffic.  There is no downside to the 571.  Looks like a banana too!  Makes me hungry for a big, banana right now!!!  The banana slicer 571 hangs well in the shower or on your rearview mirror for those moments you just gotta have a banana.  There used to be days where the complications of going to the office with my banana was out of the question.  There's just no good way to carry a banana!  But the H571 changed all of that.  I can put it in the sole of my shoe or in my back pocket and I tell you that you will be well prepared to take on the day!  One piece of advice is to briefly freeze the banana for easier slicing.  But if your banana gets too hard it is impossible to cut and unfortunately you are out of luck for an hour or so.  I love my 571!!!"
"You know, once I had my pineapple puller, my strawberry-thingy-taker-outer, my avocado-slicer, and my tomato-cutter, I thought my life was complete.  I was able to sail through my days on an even keel, feeling serene and happy in the knowledge that all my food-prep-battles were over. I had forgotten about the banana.  I had forgotten how I would stand there, day after tortuous day, first pulling a banana from the bunch (and when are they going to come up with a banana de-buncher, that's what I want to know?), then laboriously peeling it, THEN taking a knife . . . one sharp enough to cut through the soft, sweet flesh of the fruit, but not so sharp as to slash my wrists as I thought about the tedium of the task at hand . . . and then . . . why, my stars and garters!  On Christmas morning, there it was.  Well, to be fair, I thought my husband was just being coy when I opened it. I blushed and had to hide it from the in-laws, but that wonderful man, with a twinkle in his eye, gently reached out and pulled it from my quivering hand and said, ""No, sweetie.  This isn't like the Valentine's Day gift I bought you.  This is something you can proudly display in our kitchen."" The gasps from my mother-in-law, followed by a quick sip of her brandied eggnog, brought me out of my reverie as he showed us all how it works.  Well, he tried.  He just could NOT get the damn banana to conform to the direction of the cutter!  He was upset at first, but then laughingly set the slicer down and said, ""We'll figure it out.  I mean, if we could figure out how that . . . you know . . . works, we can figure THIS out!""  I kissed him and took his banana into my hands and said, ""Yes.  We will figure it out."""

"The Tuscan milk was delivered to my home half full.  The safety ring on the cap had been removed, and the milk smelled of burnt leaves and pepto bismol.  I ordered a ""new"" gallon...  It looks as if someone drank my damn milk and replaced it with goat semen and pickle seasoning, a common substitute for fresh Tuscan milk.  I decided to drink the remaining contents in my $45.00 gallon of fresh ""white"", and ended up liking it.  For that, I give 3 stars."

"I have enjoyed using the H571 Slicer; however, I was unable to give the product 5 stars because it just doesn't perform quite as advertised.""- Faster, safer than using a knife- Great for cereal- Plastic, dishwasher safe- Slice your banana with one quick motion- Kids love slicing their own bananas""I have found the H571 faster than a knife for any and all needs. Period. I hunt as a hobby, and have always dreamed of killing a deer with nothing but a knife, but as you can imagine the deer are way too fast for me to accomplish this impossible task. I have tried for years. However, the Hutzler 571 is much faster than a knife, and I bagged my first buck last month, and two others since then. And as miraculous as it sounds, the H571 really was safer, for myself and for the deer. There was no pain or blood as it slew, skinned, and filleted the animal in one quick motion. My family will now survive the winter. The only reason I couldn't give the H571 five stars is because it says it is great for cereal, but the cereal just falls between the spaces and is not sliced or chopped in any way."

"After taking delivery of my Hutzler 571 in 2011, I found -- just like that one guy -- that all of my bananas were bent the wrong way as well.

"I try to be really aware of gender stereotyping as a parent. My children were always allowed to play with whatever interested them, whether it was a flowered vest and pink guitar for Justin because he thought he looked like Kiss wearing it, or Jenna wanting the ""Boys Only Manual for the Building of Some Serious S*** That Girls Shouldn't Even Attempt."" (Kidding about the title but you can bet your panties I'd buy it, if it existed.)Anyway, I always try to make sure that there are no restrictions on play because of some perceived gender association. You wanna wear mommy's boots and play with the toy kitchen? Cool. You wanna play with toy trucks and pretend to shave? That's cool too. Letting children play with toys meant for a specific gender opposite them won't ""turn"" them gay, increase femininity, emasculate or downplay future career choice.Why am I writing this?

Is that true, Mom?""No, baby, it's not true but his parents probably need a good sitting down and talking to. Maybe even some time in the naughty corner.Please stop perpetuating gender myths when it comes to children and their play. Thanks and have a great day.

We should have nationalized healthcare like every other civilized nation on the planet, but apparently my fellow Americans just don't want it.  They're barely willing to tolerate the incredibly mild reforms in the ACA. Hell, people are furious at the president because their terrible fake insurance is being replaced by cheaper insurance that actually insures them.  ""But but but you said I could keep eating dirt and paying for the privilege if I wanted!  Liar!  Liar! "" We've been trying for single payer since Teddy Roosevelt's day, and it got him kicked out of his own party.  This sort of ""everything new is pants-pissingly terrifying"" mindset is why we still won't use the damn metric system. As much as I think my country NEEDS single payer, realistically I have to admit that the majority of us apparently don't WANT it, so I'll take whatever petty improvements we can get."

Their response was ""you're different"" and moved on.

"I used to be quite a happy fellow. I had a wonderful, beautiful wife whom I was madly in love with. I felt like I was on top of the world. But one day it all came crashing down around me. My wife blindsided me with the news: ""I'm not happy, I want a divorce."" I couldn't believe it, I felt like someone had torn the heart from my chest and implanted it into a pig and then shot that pig out of a cannon into a brick wall smashing it into a pink paste and that paste then collected and formed into all sorts of delicious pork-products which are then cooked to perfection and served to the Westboro Baptist Church. It was a very specific feeling. She finally revealed that she had been sleeping with Jim, my best friend/co-worker/guy-I-experimented-with-sexually-in-college/bro. Naturally I couldn't just let them ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after, so I plotted my revenge. For months I researched and planned the perfect retribution and waited until the time was right. I hid in the back seat of Jim's car, he never saw it coming. When he awoke he found himself bound and naked with his penis laid out on the table where me and my wife made passionate love while Jim hid in the bushes outside and watched through the window and masturbated. He didn't think we knew he was there, but we knew. Why else would we do it on the table with the curtains open if not to be seen? Where was I? Oh, right. Jim, Jim's penis, table. Jim asked what was going on and I replied with my trademark slow evil laugh as I am known to do when exacting my revenge. Then I withdrew my weapon, a 571 banana slicer. Jim pleaded with me not to but he should have known something like this would happen after helping me dispose of all those bodies. I placed the 571 over Jim's penis, which was conveniently curved to the right almost matching the 571's curve perfectly. However the slicer did not perform as expected. It's plastic construction works on the soft flesh of a ripe banana but is useless on a wife-stealing man's penis. I gave up and decided to fix myself a bowl of cereal. Several bites in I realized I hate bananas and that I had neglected to wash the slicer which was probably why my Golden Grahms tasted slightly of wang. It works great on bananas but I knocked it down for it's poor performance on male anatomy and the johnson-taste contamination."

"Yea, yea, ... I read the reviews of this shirt and thought they were amusing. I shared them with the assistants at my office and we all had a good laugh.  I thought it would be a nice prank gift for one of my assistants who was leaving for a brighter future. When the package came, I wrapped it up and handed it to her the next day. She questioned, ""What is this...a 3 wolf t-shirt?"". A chill ran down my spine. How did she know that?? Was it just a lucky guess, or was the mere fact that she held this mysterious item  possibly having some kind of supernatural effect already?  I decided not to freak out, and I just smiled. She opened up the gift wrap and her eyes lit up, but not in a nice kind of way. She looked subtly different, in a wild, primitive way. She seemed to clutch the shirt with more enthusiasm than was necessary, and she looked around the room like a predator who was guarding it's newly caught kill. I remained calm and went about my business. Hoping against hope that I didn't make a mistake by buying this shirt. The next day, she comes in the office wearing the shirt. Everything about her was different. Her blue jeans were torn up and she was walking with a limp. I didn't comment on the jeans, but I asked about the limp. She simply replied, with no emotion, ""I've been running a lot"". Did I detect a slight growl in her voice? I can't say. Then I notice these tattoos on her arms, ankles and feet that I never noticed before.  The strange thing was that each tattoo was less meaningful than the next one, to me at least. The rest of the day went smooth enough, I thought.  Until later, when another assistant, came into the office. This other girl is mysterious enough on her own, without a 3 wolf t-shirt. Very anti-social, extremely intelligent, incredibly accident prone (like we are talking regular trips to the ER) and overall hard to figure out. To my total bewilderment, the two of them are now best buds! And in a weird kind of way! I think the girl with the 3 wolf t-shirt is now kind of controlling the other one. She is getting her to do all kinds of little errands for her, and somehow cast a spell on her. The weirdest thing is the other one is still very accident prone, but she heals up very quickly now, like supernaturally! Just this morning T-shirt assistant (she still works in the office, that's another strange  thing that I think the t-shirt is responsible for) tells me how they went out the other night, and the other girl fell down a complete flight of steps violently, like the kind of accident where people break bones and end up in traction! 10 minutes later, the other girl walks in with nothing more than a bandage around her elbow. The girl who got the t-shirt just smiled with a knowing look on her face that she is now more powerful as every day goes by. So, my review for the 3 wolf t-shirt is more of a warning.  If you buy this, you will need to be ready for a lot of turmoil in your life.  You will have to accept what comes your way and not fight the urge to freak out, because you will have that urge. You will have to deal with the knowing that buying this t-shirt can change someone's life drastically.  Don't believe those other reviews, it's not just all fun at Walmart! I have to live every day now knowing that this innocent young lady I gave the shirt to now may be on the road to ruin. Hopefully I can write a book about it and then a movie. I will make a fortune."

"It's the Tuscan Cows make this milk taste magical. All my life I knew there was something not quite right about the milk I had been consuming. I can tell by the smooth flavor that my particular cow had been very well treated, allowed to roam the hills of Tuscany. Having been imported from Italy I knew the price would be a little steep (I opted for the $98.99 fearing the $45 was a knock off) but it was worth every penny."
"At first I didn't understand the question but then realised it was a product.Disappointed that this product was less radioactive than the Tuna that I imported from Fukushima (who have since evolved legs and have joined the local Womens Institute - I now have a regular supply of Bakewell Tarts and well-risen if slightly salty sponge cakes).However, on the upside I no longer need to spend money on haircuts or dentist visits since all my hair and teeth fell out.It seems to help with weight loss too."

"When I first heard about Tuscan Whole Milk, I didn't know what to think.  Was it just your typical milk from a cow?  Or maybe it was rats being milked for their milk like you hear in some stories.  But no.  What I found would change my life forever.If you look at the label, you'll see a city skyline with a cow jumping over the moon.  Many see this and assume it's just a logo.  But no, it's a version of their secret for how to extract this delicious milk.  The company actually owns a 82-story building which they take the cows to the roof to milk them.  The reasoning for the high price is because the cows can only be milked once.  You may ask yourself, why?  Here is where the secret comes in:  They attach an apparatus called Trimilkernator.  This apparatus attaches itself to the cow's nipples like a bungee cord and then when it's fully ready, the cow is pushed off the roof. The Trimilkernator is able to extract 4 gallons of milk before the cow hits the floor and splatters all over.  This is the real reason you see a cow 'flying' over a city as their logo. The rush of the cow falling to it's death adds a special flavor to the milk which is unmatched anywhere.Little known facts:- It can be used as a gas alternative.- It has been marked illegal by the NCAA, NBA, NFL, and MLS due to it's athletic enhancements (think steroids x 10).- You can find a bottle of it in many rap videos from 1995-2003.  Just look for it.- It has been known to give you photographic memory after 2 weeks of drinking at least 8oz each day.Hope this helps you guys make the choice and give this milk a try."

"BUYER BEWARE!!!  I bought this shirt to replace my tshirt that I have been wearing to bed for the last 25+ years.  I didn't take any of the reviews on this shirt seriously but I insist on wearing clothes with mystical creatures to bed so I decided to give it a try.  Well needless to say I was two hours late for work the next day after waking up completely naked in the woods.  The only tracks I found were 4 paw prints so I followed them in hopes I could make it back to civilization.  When I finally made it back home I learned that something had ripped my neighbor's dog in half, 4 neighbors were bitten, and the local Pet store is now completely empty.  When I go to take a shower, my bath tub is completely filled with dog food and I have no clue how it got there.Usually I'd call it quits after all that but the artistry on the shirt is so majestic and grandiose so I decided to order another one.  But if that happens again then I'm done with that shirt for life.This shirt would make a great gift but just make sure they don't live near you."
"Every banana I've ever seen curves the other way. Didn't they do any market research before they sent this to production? I mean, my God, how hard is that? Now I've got a banana slicer that curves to the right, and all my bananas curve to the left. ""Use Southern Hemisphere bananas,"" my friend says. But what she doesn't understand is that it's not where they grow, it's where they are. I'd have to take all my bananas to South America for them to curve to the right. Is Hutzler an Australian company or something? Jeez.  Major waste of not very much money."

"I think just as tons of more ""liberal"" people have been twisting the Pope's words for sensationalist headlines (and then when corrected seem to blame anything or anyone other than their own initial misconception), this is also a pretty sensationalist headline from the other side.   I think this article is *slightly* more honest than the NY Times or Huffington Post was (not saying much), it still misses the point entirely.  Vatican Headline:  ""Pope: Lord save us from the subtle conspiracies of worldliness""AsiaNews Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"", ""fruit of the spirit of the world that negotiates everything” even faith""Free Republic Headline: ""God save us from the ""hegemonic uniformity” of the ""one line of thought"" (Slams progressives)""The Gateway Pundit (posted to r/Christianity): ""POPE FRANCIS Blasts Progressive Movement – “The Fruit of the Devil”""And of course the latter will get more pageclicks, just like ""Pope Says Church Is ‘Obsessed’ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control"" got way way more pageclicks than ""A Big Heart Open to God"".*Worldliness* is the Spirit of the Devil.   Some progressives consider any proverbial ""move forward"" as being more important than their own fidelity to the Faith.

"This product has revolutionized the banana slicing market!  I knew from day one that this is how we were meant to slice our favorite parthenocarpic fruits. Before I bought this product, I used to chip down chunks of flint rock in an attempt to replicate how the Native Americans used to slice their bananas.  I can not tell you how many banana flint tools I went through before receiving this product.I can't get enough of it.  I take it with me every where I go.  I had a custom, hand-crafted banana slicer sheath made for it so it is always on my side.  I can't leave home without it.  I take it with me to the grocery store so I can check the quality of the bananas I am about to purchase.  Sometimes I go a little overboard and end up slicing every banana I see.  It is getting increasingly difficult for me to find places to purchase bananas at anymore.  I have been banned from so many grocery stores that I have had to move my family and I to three different cities in the hopes of being able to indulge in my banana slicing addiction.Now my addiction to slicing and eating bananas is so bad that I am experiencing symptoms of potassium overdose.  I didn't even know that was possible until I bought this thing.  Now I am experiencing cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, muscle spasms, irritability, fatigue, thready pulse and heart failure.I only gave this a four star rating because of the overdosing of potassium and an unfortunate incident it caused when I tried to board an international flight with my banana slicer strapped to my side."

"For years, I had heard about the Hutzler, but I had no idea it was a banana slicer.  I'm overjoyed to see its real purpose, and can only once again add a big ""thank you"" to Hutzler for saving my grandfather's life.Granddad was a prisoner of war in WWII after the experimental blimp he was piloting developed a leak and crashed to the earth (after an unfortunate homing pigeon accident, in which the pigeon and two of the crew plummeted to their deaths).  From the moment he landed in Stalag 666,  he and his bunkmates focused on escape - a feat that the commandant had announced on Granddad's first day was impossible.  ""You can't tunnel out,"" he said, ""you can't pole vault over the wire, and after last year's episode, you'll never again sneak out disguised as a French acrobatic ballet troupe.""Although a tunnel seemed like the most romantic way to flee (due to the fact that news of Steve McQueen's daring ""Great Escape"" had already reached Stalag 666), there was an almost insuperable problem.  The earth under the camp was moist and sticky.  When the men dug with makeshift shovels, it simply stuck to the implements and was almost impossible to move.  The men would try digging with their hands, but the muddy mess stuck to them like ... bananas.  Unpleasant, gooey and unwieldy (although surprisingly tasty).  And the cleanup was impossible.  After a day below ground, the men were covered with telltale, clinging residue.  The men looked in vain for another escape route.All of that changed when a ""CARE package"" arrived from the Red Cross, in the bottom of which was a tool simply called ""the Hutz.""  It was perfect.  It cut through the earth like nothing before it, and rendered the dirt into evenly-spaced, round chunks, which could easily be dropped into the parade ground from secret compartments in the men's trousers and kicked into the turf, like so many ... uh, ""dog pellets,"" as the prisoners affectionately called them.  Granddad once told me, ""The Hutz?  It was a miracle.  And the cleanup?  Fantastic!  No muss, no fuss.""There was only one close call with the Hutz.  During a routine check of the barracks, a guard discovered the Hutz hidden in Granddad's bunk.  ""Vat is diss?"" screamed the guard.  Gramps, playing for time, said, ""My wife sent it to me ... it's a, uh, cookie cutter ... .""  ""Und vy to you need a cookie cutter?"" the guard inquired.  ""She thought we'd have a lot more time to bake than we do.""  After a tense few moments that seemed like an eternity, the guard threw the Hutz to Granddad, muttering, ""Stupid Americans ... who would cut a cookie to look like a banana? ... und vun in little pieces at that?""After 10 months of hard digging with the Hutz, the tunnel was finished, and 32 men escaped before the Germans discovered it, tipped off by the sound of ecstatic escaped prisoners singing in the nearby woods, ""Yes, We Have No Bananas.""  Granddad, one of the first to get out, hung onto the Hutz, thinking it might come in handy sometime.Space doesn't permit the recounting of Granddad's perilous trip out of Germany, how he used the Hutz to ""neutralize"" a Gestapo informer, how he seduced and turned the Danish ""Mata Hari"" with the Hutz, how he shared a train car with the Von Trapp Family and was able to sedate the smaller Von Trapps with the Hutz, or how he was forced to finally trade the Hutz with a corrupt border guard in Switzerland for safe passage to Bern, but I can say that Granddad used to get teary-eyed when he would talk about it.  ""I'd never seen a tool like the Hutz, and I never will again,"" he'd say with admiration and longing.Thank heavens the Hutz is now available for one and all.  I've given one to my own grandchildren as a part of our precious family heritage.  I'm holding my Hutz in my left hand right now as I type this with my right, with tears streaming down my cheeks.  What a marvelous tool!  I just wish Granddad were still alive to see it."

"It was some six years ago that I first came across Tuscan Whole Milk here on Amazon.  I thought to myself, ""I have to try that.""  So I got out my credit card, and ordered a gallon.It was going to take five business days for delivery. That was five days that would run into the expiration date. Five less days to enjoy my Tuscan Whole Milk. I thought about it for awhile, and decided that I could finish the gallon within a week. I hated to rush the use of milk of such high caliber, but sometimes these types of sacrifices must be made for the greater good. I went forward as planned.To my chagrin, the post office went on strike during this five day business week.A strike that lasted two weeks. What was I to do? There would be no way that my Tuscan whole milk would make it unscathed in that amount of time.I went on with life as if nothing were wrong. I had a smile on the outside, but my friends new nothing of what was going on inside. Oh, the turmoil.The strike ended after two weeks, but the Tuscan Whole Milk still did not come.At this point it had been a month and four and a half days. I was in the kitchen waiting on my baked potato to bake. In the meantime I was cutting up some chives. Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. It was the Post...Person. She handed me a package and said, ""This wouldn't fit in your box."" I grabbed the package, and ran into the kitchen. I sliced open the package, carefully, and there was my gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk.  I retrieved a bowl from the cupboard, opened the lid, and began to pour. The milk poured out thick, and with a somewhat sour smell. Clyde, my cat, wandered over, took one whiff, and turned his nose up at my long awaited Tuscan Whole Milk. I was distraught. As he turned around, his tail knocked the bowl with my chives in it, into the bowl of the sour Tuscan Whole Milk. I picked up the bowl of Tuscan Whole Milk, stirred it a little, got a potato chip, dipped it, and brought it to my mouth. The taste was over whelming. My Tuscan Whole Milk had been saved. I thought to myself, ""That makes a Hell'uva Good Dip.""As I sit here, in prison for trademark infringement, writing this; I rue the day Tuscan Whole Milk walked into my life."
"I have two small children who love bananas. They each eat at least one per day. I've always just unpeeled the banana and handed it to them whole. When I stumbled upon this banana slicer at Amazon I was totally dumbfounded. Who has ever heard of SLICING bananas? Well, I showed my 4 year old daughter the picture and told her what it did and she thought having sliced bananas would be really cool. So, I was about to hit the Purchase button, when I started thinking...You see, I'm one of those crazy people who is always trying to find ways to do things myself. And if I've learned anything from Alton Brown, it's that you shouldn't have any ""single use"" only items in your kitchen. At first, I was hoping this banana slicer might work on hot dogs, but after reading another reviewer's experience wherein burning hot dog juice squirted in his eye, I figured it wasn't worth the risk.So I started trying to figure out how I could do this banana slicing thing myself. Again, thanks to the reviews, I've learned that using hammers, fingers, ceiling fans, axes, band saws, etc have varying degrees of success and bodily damage possibilities. But then... IT HIT ME. A knife! Well, needless to say, I pulled out a butter knife (no sharp edges in our house), peeled back that banana and sliced it right up for my daughter. She was so happy to have a sliced banana (she even ate it with a fork! Off a plate!) and I saved myself 4 dollars!Your household may go through more bananas than mine does. But with just 2 bananas per day, I've decided to use a knife. If we routinely went through 3 bananas or more per day, I might invest in this product, but it's not right for us at this time. So, assess your family's needs and make the decision that works for you, but there ARE other options out there!I gave it 4 stars because I love the color yellow."

"What you hold in your hands is ultimate power. Simply glide it through a ripe banana and you've got a ripe, sliced banana. Not even kidding. That easy!But a word of caution - it's for bananas - NOT for anything in that shape!

Remember, know your limitations and you should be okay with this slicer."

I like this video but not as much as the one where he promises to end wire tapping.  Although the one about closing gitmo asap was good too.  It ties for my other favorite which is where he claimed Libya was caused by a video.  But you cant forget about his bailouts those videos are always worth a watch after all he kept Detroit running.  You can not mention favorite videos tho without talking about his absolute disgust of raising the debt limit while a part time congress person.

"Having read all of the reviews (which took a LOT of time, but research is very important to me), I decided to go ahead and order my Hutzler banana slicer. Unfortunately, due to its curvature, about half of the time it's the wrong shape for my bananas, resulting in a tremendous waste. (Nearly HALF of the bananas I peel have to be discarded or eaten whole because they curve the wrong way for the Hutzler 571 slicer.) It would be nice if they offered these in a ""matched pair"" set, one curved to the left and the other curved to the right, instead of the right-curved one only. It seems that the entire world is biased against left-handed anythings, this being the latest example of this prejudice in design, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing. I mean really, would it have been that hard to offer both? And they could have doubled their sales, too. When it works, it works great (5 stars), but when it doesn't, it's a total waste. Thus the 3-star review."

"I got immersed into the world of collectible banana slicers a few years ago. It started with a pretty generic model, the Chiquita 2000, and I was hooked. It was a great conversation starter when I had guests over, when I proudly displayed the Platano 4120 and the Cream Pie TURBO on my mantle. ""Uh, is that a... banana slicer?"" family and friends would say, and I could tell they were envious. Do I always check to make sure they are safely in their padlocked display cases before any guests leave the house? Yes... yes I do.Of course I never use any banana slicer as it would interfere with it's re-sale value, and I'm definitely building my collection based on long term value... collectible banana slicers are my retirement, and I plan on riding that banana boat all the way to a private island!When I got the press release on the Hutzler 571, the banana slicer message boards were lit up... I could hardly even get a comment in! I placed my order on Amazon with overnight shipping... WHAT?! BACK ORDERED?! Alas, good things come to those who wait.When the Hutzler 571 FINALLY came after months on the backorder list, I anxiously tore apart the packaging. I even had a custom display case already made based on the dimensions that were posted on Reddit! But when I saw the slicer......say wha? Is this a sick joke? It was exactly the same as the 570, but with a decorative little top added. I couldn't believe this was the much-hyped newer model. Come on, Hutzler... this isn't going to pay for my private island next to Richard Branson! I like the decorative details, but I don't know if this is worthy of the collectible display case."

"I prefer it!  I'm a Texan and a while back I had a HORRIBLE kidney stone but I didn't know what it was because I had never had one before, I went to the ER in EXCRUCIATING pain and they treated me wonderfully! I got three, count 'em baby three, shots of morphine through an IV, that is an experience I have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend!  Then I left with a handful of prescriptions after a CT scan (is that right?  Some kind of scan! ) and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again.  Woo! So then the bill comes and it's $8000!  So at first I was all like ""woah, shit"" so I called and complained because while in the ER I had specifically ask, repeatedly, how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors, nurses, radiologists (or whatever they're called) and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay ""as much as I could afford right now"" (I authorized 50$ because she wouldn't explain to me what exactly it was I was paying for ""right now"" and I finally decided they just wanted a card on file). Sooo when the bill comes the scan ALONE was 6000 bucks, just the scan, the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which I would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care I got (and I knew I was uninsured going into this and I knew ERs are expensive and at the time I was in HORRIBLE pain and scared shitless by it so I didn't care).  I made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for JUST THE SCAN?  That seemed unreasonable to me and I also found out later that scans like that aren't necessary for kidney stones and often aren't done unless you're peeing blood, so wtf? So this is where the fun starts, I called to complain about this scan cost, I was quite clear that I would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but I couldn't afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts, so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if I qualified for ""financial relief"" from my bill.  I explained again that I didn't want charity, I just wanted a reasonable bill (and BTW, 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too, 800 of that is called an ""ER fee"" and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the ER regardless of what happens next, but hey they took good care of me and I don't know what the fuck morphine costs). Anyway the only option I had was to file for the charitable relief, well ya see I am currently a ""stay at home uncle"" my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom, she can't afford day care (you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is) and since I made less money than she does, I become the stay at home parent.  We all live together now, she pays the bills and I take care of the kids.  It was weird at first but it's actually kinda rewarding and fun now (most of the time).  So technically I'm single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that.  Actually do have some income for contract IT work with people who knew me before I quit, it's all under the table though. Soooo I got FULL relief.  I actually have some money and my mother actually makes ""ok"" money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill (my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time, lower is better of course but I had braced myself to accept 4 grand if I could negotiate hard enough to get there).  Instead I paid 0$.  And I learned a valuable lesson, if it looks like you have no money you can go to the ER for freeeeee!  Wee! So suck it tax payers I ripped you off for 8000 bucks and I have three pain pills left over for a rainy day! Now stupid Obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance :( boooo That's going to be like 70$ a month.  EVERY month!  You even have to pay in December!  Come on government, it's baby Jesus birthday, fucking dicks."
"I'm not so sure that I'm going to keep the banana slicer. You see, all the product documentation said that it would work with a Mac but I can't seem to figure it out.

I called the nice folks at Apple and they told me to take it to the Genius Bar at the nearest store but the nearest store is actually 400 miles from me. I sure wish someone would update the product description. I bet we see this on Woot.com soon :)"

"I have been using the 571 Banana slicer day and night since it arrived.  I am up to 466 bananas as I write this. Other than the disturbing squishing sound that I make as I slog through my kitchen, the device is working fine.

Guiness says I am competing with another one of your users, but they are not peeling theirs so I am way ahead.Thank you in advance for your response."
"This product has saved me thousands of dollars worth of hormones and surgery!  I started my gender reassignment surgery 4 years ago (male to female).

Well, I had a good friend of mine recommend this product as part of the transition and within a week of writing with these sleek little cuties I started to really 'blossom' up top.  Two weeks later I was able to stop the hormones and cancel my final planned surgery.  The estimate for the gender reassignment was $23,500, but I only had to spend $19,440 ( plus $7.49 for the pens).  Two years and three beautiful children later I must attest that I am a VERY happy BIC customer!  THANK YOU BIC!"

"So I decided to make my purchase about a week or so ago. I was young and willing. Ready to try new things and accomplish new feats. Milk was on that list undoubtedly.When I brought it back home, it sat there on my counter. Almost with a grimace upon its face. This was the milk's challenge to me. He was saying, ""C'mon, drink me. You won't, you wont."" I surely denied his assumed accusation. ""But I will, this is your purpose here. I shall not be taking such criticism from a loathe of a gallon such as yourself.""After sometime the acid wore off. I woke up covered in sweat. I remembered that gallon still sat in my kitchen, questioning...instigating. Then it hit me. It was him....the one....my mother warned me about...Why here? Why now? This is how it will be?Part 2 coming soon."
"For years, my go-to banana slicer was my handy-dandy Swiss Army knife. Late for class? Use my pocketknife to slice me up a banana. Just ran a 5K? Out comes the pocketknife to slice up a banana. Ordering dessert in a fancy restaurant? Nothing impresses a date like whipping out my Swiss Army knife and slicing up bananas for my table-side Bananas Flambé. But now, Hutzler, you bring modern technology to the table with your 571 Banana Slicer. This incredible, time-saving gadget now lets me demonstrate my speed and dexterity along with my mad banana-slicing skills. No more careful easing out of the correct retracted knife blade. No more questions about how many Swiss soldiers eat bananas. No more tedious, one-minute lag time between peeling the banana and eating it! Hutzler, thank you, deeply, for adding minutes to my day and more bananas to my diet. One suggestion: a key ring would make the slicer even more portable, virtually eclipsing that Swiss contraption."

"Well, when my Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer came in the mail, I was understandably exited. After reading all the reviews, the only problem I saw was that it only cuts right curving bananas. That was not a problem for me because I only buy right curving bananas, as they are much tastier than left curving ones. But when I opened the package to my dismay I saw a LEFT curving banana slicer! I had to send the product back and I am very disappointed that I will have to continue slicing my bananas the old fashioned way for another two weeks."

"after a painful mishap with Emma Boston Terrier - 10x10 Iron On Heat Transfer For White Material I found myself in need of one-handed kitchen implements.Even without the painful scarring and blistering, I was very excited to try this product, after years of grueling banana slicing with an extremely sharp, ergonomically-handled, high-end kitchen knife.We've all been there.It just wasn't working out.But have to tell you, I'm kind of disappointed.Very simply, this device is only good for bananas that curve to the right.It's early on a Saturday. You've just started your first cup of coffee as you stumble around your kitchen, getting breakfast together for your kid(s); capable of little more than grunting and pointing.  You grab a banana, your handy-dandy banana slicer, and... it's a left curving banana.  Do you just throw the whole thing away, or do you accept that your right-curving banana slicer will cut maybe half the banana, leaving large, uncut pieces at the top and bottom?You drink coffee and stare at the banana.You drink coffee and stare at the slicer.""#$^#$%."" You say,under your breath so that the kids don't hear you,  sipping more coffee.You have a discreet little scratch, and ponder your options.You use it to cut half the banana, and reach into the drawer for the sharp, ergonomically-handled kitchen knife.  You know that knives are not your friend this early in the morning, but the banana won't slice itself now, will it?You had such high hopes when you saw this product on Amazon, and pictured how well it would go with the Hutzler Cereal Spooner, and the Hutzler Automatic Milk Carton Tipper.""#$^#$%"" you sigh, taking another sip of coffee, and reaching for a dull butter knife instead.  No sense losing a finger this early in the morning."
"When I ran across Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz I smiled as pleasant memories flooded my recollection.  As I child I would wait eagerly at the table in my dirty smock, picking scabs.  I'd hear my mother's limping footsteps as she staggered into the room, a big warm bowl of fresh milk shlorping in her withered hands.  My half-witted brother would utter shrill peeps of excitement and rise as far as his chains would permit before I yanked him back down on his bench so I could claim my share.  Well do I remember his moans of envy and Mother's rasping chortle as I slurped deeply of the creamy white nectar, redolent of Swiss meadows, tinkling cow bells and bosomy dirndl-clad milk maids named Inga.When I asked Mother why our milk was so good, she would smile her gap-toothed grin and point to the nuclear power plant that towered over our little farm.  The milk had a curious tingly buzz and faint whiff of ozone that Mother said was ionizing radiation.  It would keep for months without refrigeration.So when I saw Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz on Amazon, I couldn't resist.  I ordered a tin of uranium ore from Amazon along with it.  When it arrived in the post, I poured myself a big bowl, mixed in the ore and had a long slurp.  It was just the way I remembered it!  The rich texture, the tingle, the flies.  All that was missing was my brother's envious gurgles.Highly recommended!"

Finally, with a safe, pastel color and assurances from an impersonal company marketing exec that these pens are ""for her,"" I feel like I can finally give the women in my life a pen which they can handle comfortably and not feel like a man when they use it.  They even spell Cristal incorrectly, just so that special woman you give these pens to can draw a little heart over the letter i and cute-up that sterile, hyper-masculine package they come in.  Of course, I'd never allow a -man- to use one of these.  Goodness, one touch of the pastel pen and it's off to emasculation city!I suggest you also check out Bic's Testosterpens for Him, too.  They come with a free box of shotgun shells and a torque wrench, and really, what man doesn't need another box of 12 gauge shells and a handy tool?

"There aren't many people who really know how to appreciate Tuscan Whole Milk. In the first place, most pronounce it wrong. They say Tuss as in a walrus tusk when really the sound is closer to Tooth. Think tooth-kon.Now, to open the jug one does not simply unscrew the cap. The proper method is, while seated, to hold the jug by tightly pinching its cap so that it is suspended between 5"" and 6"" above one's lap. Then, grip the handle with the index and middle finger of your non-dominant hand and rotate the jug(!), and not the cap.You'll know the bottle is open when the jug hits your lap - it's this thud that really activates the flavor. Tip: Should you be fortunate enough to have droplets of the Tuscan Whole Milk emerge from the bottle, do chase these droplets with your mouth as these will generally have the greatest concentration of nutrients. You'll notice how much more nutrienty the droplets taste.Now, leave the jug open to let it breathe. How long you say? Each jug is different, but if you listen with a stethoscope placed on the upper portion of the jug beneath the spout you should hear it begin to hum the distinctive Tuscan(tm) tone when the jug is ready. Here's a bit of trivia: most people believe there are seven natural music notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) but there is an 8th. The note ""T"" - the Tuscan(tm) tone.(Somewhere on eBay, someone claims to be selling a Grandest Piano, which, unlike a Grand Piano which has only 88 keys, also includes 7 more T keys. A bargain at $1.7T, and though I've been saving my pennies - I use those pennies every time I invest 4500¢ in a 1 gal, 128 fl. oz. jug of Tuscan Whole Milk.)Now, you could always pour the Tuscan Whole Milk into a glass and sip - if you want to be labeled a savage by society's elite. Instead, pour the Tuscan Whole Milk into a saucer with cotton balls. Allow the cotton balls to fully soak before placing them under your tongue. Enjoy!"

Despite the false advertisement when it comes to cereal, this slicer changed my life when it comes to slicing bananas.  Patiently waiting for a combined banana/cereal slicer, come on Hutzler!"

I insisted I tale out a loan using my house for collateral and have a white church wedding (I am an atheist but I wanted the photographs to look traditional) with an enormous reception with lots of balloons and decked in swags of pink with lots of flowers. My daughter even designed our giant cupcake style wedding cake and looked so pretty in her pink dress as maid if honour. Only now do I see the depth of that gracious title and see how that £3000 white dress made me feel so sexy and yet virginal all at the same time. (Despite being quite a nymphomaniac in reality) I even hired a man to pose as my father and 'give me away.' and found a jolly chimney sweep for good luck. No sooner as I had the ring on my finger telling the world I was no longer free but belonged to my man that things went from bad to worse! Before all our family to the strains of 'you are the wind beneath my wings' we went to dign the wedding register. I insisted that we use my pink Cristil pen, it had made me so happy and made the day possible. I signed first being 'a lady ' then my husband went to sign. As he picked up the pen, his rugged good looks fell away, his skin looked amazing and his hair fell in soft gentle waves. He looked into the distance wistfully and then at my brother, who came out recently after years of denial after a gift of your wondrous pens. (He cannot use them properly of course having large sized mannish hands but he is still grateful to be liberated at last) Some secret seemed to pass between them in a long gaze. My husband blushed girlishly and burst into tears saying he could not 'live a lie' and ran from the church hand in hand with my brother Tarquin!!! They took off in his new smartcar with the bumper sticker 'powered by fairydust' and havn't been seen since. I am now a single oarent. I am living on the street as I have lost my house to the bank as the wedding was never finalised so I was liable for all the debt of the wedding and of course resigned from my job to become a happy comtent housewife. My daughter has becone addicted to chocolate through stress and increased hormones and is now turning tricks for Galaxy Caramel and selling erotic cupcakes to fund her next fix. I was doing reasonably well as my revived looks and increased cupsize gave me a regular clientel for my Big Issue sales but when my final pink pen ran out last wk I went into premature menopause, flipped out and got a bit stabby with it! I sm now in a women's prison and am Big Charlie's bitch! (I think her pudgy paws have never caressed a real woman's oen in her life) I tried to write to my daughter but could not obviously as they only supply black or ovcasional blue 'men sized' pens. Life is hellish here. I had a postcard last wk from my brother in Accapulco but that only nafe things worse. Customers should be warned of the dangers of using these pens and your company should be more respinsible in the oackaging details. They should come with adaquate warnings I feel so women can make a thoughtful if not 'educated' desision in chosing them. I must apologise for my awful spelling in this review. Prior to using Cristil pens I was an ace spelling Bee champ, now i am krap at spelling I find. I give these pens a 3 buyer beware!!!!!"

The truth is out of style
"[New Review]: After accidentally spilling one drop of this unholy goo onto my Starz vinyl LP collection, the records began melting into a single blob. But, similar to the phoenix rising from the ashes, the melted blob then slowly took on the form of a super-record, the likes of which I'd never seen.This super-record stood about, oh, yay high and bared the name STARZ - Starzongas. At first out of fear I tried not to make eye contact, but after a few moments I came to sense that this record was there to help me. It contained the band's best songs from their illustrious career, but also included all their great songs they had never recorded or got around to writing in the first place. One stand out was the magnificent ""Banana Boat"" with the irresistible chorus ""Banana Boat .... Baby I got your goat .... on the Banana Boat .... Chickee Chickee Baa Baa .... Chickee Chickee Baa Baa ..."". Up yours Capitol Records. Other unwritten standouts are of course ""Coliseum Rock All Night"" with it's 36 min guitar solo and ""Jumpin' Handclap Marvin"", a bouncy song with some of the best wordplay Michael Lee Smith never wrote.As you may expect, the Starz super-record swallowed up some of the lesser records next to it (bye bye Boz Scaggs - Lido Shuffle), but for the most part it leaves the good ones and my young children alone (although I will not leave it unsupervised around my teenage daughter).So if you're looking to forge Starz super-records or just wanting to get rid of Boz Scaggs, I wholeheartedly recommend spilling some of this milk. It'll be nothing to cry over, unless maybe your daughter becomes pregnant. And I suspect taking some of it orally might solve that problem as well.[Old review]: Until recently I was a loser and a shut-in, never venturing outside for anything unless it was to pull the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition from the mailbox. But after tasting Tuscan Whole Milk just once, my lifelong acne cleared up, I stopped lisping and my little black book quickly swelled to a large black book, chock full of phone numbers as I now have the confidence to talk to all the pretty ladies at Starz gigs. I even saw my first boob for Christmas! Tastes just like a milkshake and it's magical powers get to work immediately. Thank you Tuscan Whole Milk .... thank you for making me cool. Tell your cows to raise their hooves and consider themselves high-fived! Eternally in your debt, Richie S."

"I was hopeful after seeing the amazing reviews for this product, that I too could absorb its stud powers and find some good tail. Being a woman, I assumed this would work the same for me on men as it apparently had for the opposite sex. No such luck, it just brings me women. Then again, that might just be my Roller Derby league.I ordered this in the color Kale, because Kale is definitely my favorite type of green, arugula being a close second.Either way, I had worn it on a couple of outings and had not received much male attention. It was as if the shirt served as some sort of camouflage for my sexuality and I went unnoticed. I imagine this is what Harry Potter felt like when he donned the invisibility cloak to sneak by Filch in the hallways of Hogwarts.Finally the Blood Moon rolled around and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to get some attention for my shirt, and that it could at least serve as some type of ice breaker.Oh boy. What an ice breaker it was.I went to my local pub in Brooklyn and took a seat near the front of the bar. People came up to me recognizing my shirt, and also recognizing the irony of my decision to wear it during a blood moon. Soon shots were pouring of whiskeys and bourbons. Enough to put hair on my chest – if I were a man – which I am not.In all of the rowdiness, I got up and stumbled towards the restroom. I walked into the women’s room and tried to find a clean stall. Upon reaching the third and final stall, I fell to the ground in horror as I saw not the typical excrement, but a wolf spirit. He looked at me with eyes of red, and I realized this was not the kind of “tail” I was hoping to find that night.He spoke to me in a voice that sounded like a mixture of my seventh grade Reading teacher, and the sound of thunder.He told me that by wearing this shirt, on this specific night I had made an oath to lupines and lycans alike, that I would be their human foothold in this world, and do their bidding.48 hours later I woke up in my ex-boyfriend’s closet, and spent a majority of the day hiding behind his flannels. I will never again where this on a Blood Moon or even a full moon. I think it is best to maybe just wear this shirt during day light hours. Sober. Definitely sober."

I LOVE this it's amazing and does everything it says it should! I saw quite a few reviews that were complaining that the suction cups didn't work but mine work perfectly. This spiralizer is great and the price is even better. I can't even understand why anyone would spend more money on another spiralizer that this one does beautifully!
"SWITCH is 100% juice, but it is CARBONATED! Drinks like a soda, but it isn't--so much better for you and your family. I highly recommend it for families, especially teens and older who don't drink enough water or juice. It's a painless way to get them away from sodas and to drink something far more healthy! Switch comes in AWESOME flavors and this variety pack is WONDERFUL--something for everyone! From the lemon-lime to the Black Cherry, Watermelon-Strawberry to Orange-Tangerine, these all taste great, are 100% JUICE and NO ADDITIVES! Everyone in my family drinks Switch--my 76 year-old mother, my husband and my 20-something sons, all have a favorite flavor. Buying from Amazon is so easy, especially with the subscription service, you can have it auto-delivered on YOUR family's schedule! Easier than going out to the grocery store, where you will pay considerably more for a 4 pack! Amazon has the best selection and pricing on Switch that I have seen. Even the Grape flavored is superior to any other grape-artificially-flavored-syrup drink!Switch has a lovely flavor, good selection, no additives, all natural juice PLUS carbonation. It's like having the BEST OF BOTH WORLDS--juice and soda!Try Switch from Amazon today--you won't regret it and your family will LOVE IT and love you for buying it! Just don't tell them how healthy and good for them it is! ENJOY! You're gonna love it, too! I highly recommend this variety pack The Switch Variety Pack,  8.3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)"
"The Switch has truly come out with a product that should have mass appeal. A carbonated juice drink with ONLY natural sugars and it tastes great. No artificial sweeteners like Splenda or the toxic High Fructose Corn Syrup (corn sugar) just plain ole juice...though there's nothing plain about the taste of this stuff. It's fantastic.It comes in 8 flavors (6 in this variety pack) and each one has their own unique appeal. Starting with the watermelon/strawberry mix. I love it cause it's a nice blend of the two without either over powering the other to create a smooth drink that should please lovers of both flavors. The other mix is the orange/tangerine and it too is a nice blend, with the tangerine balancing out the orange very nicely. The other flavors include: Black Cherry (my personal favorite and the best tasting juice of the the entire line); Kiwi Berry (an unusual choice but I liked it even though it does have just a bit of a dull flavor); Grape (my mom liked it even though she hates grape so it's a winner. Not an over powering flavor either.) and finally lemon-lime (the one I thought I'd hate turned out to be one I actually liked enough to re-order it).I find myself drinking two or three of these a day and it's become my go to beverage after or during a meal. I also stopped drinking soda several years ago and this has been the perfect replacement for that.P.S. my mother is a diabetic and has been drinking one of these nearly every day for a few weeks now with no ill effects. Just in case anyone was wondering."

"the Switch beverages are something we have been trying to stop drinking so much soda. the downfall of this product is that we can only buy it online.  the grape flavor is popular with my husband, it is a very natural grape flavor (its not as sweet as grape juice cocktail or grape soda).  i liked this flavor better than some others.  overall, i think the product is wonderful and arrived promptly... wish it were a bit less expensive."

"Here's the definition from the article: ""Egonovism is the belief in a god and/or a religious structure that is not determined by holy text, organized religion, or religious leaders.  It is the Egonovists themselves who determine the religious doctrine.  Essentially, they make up the rules, and they decide how to follow them.  It is likely that a statistically large number of self-identified Christians fall into the Egonovism category. They may not even be aware of it, but they’ve reconstructed Christian doctrine in a way that makes sense to them.  Ignoring some parts deemed bad or irrelevant, embracing other areas containing relevant wisdom, and then filling in the blanks with their own ideas.  It’s not just Christians who do this; people from every major religion living in Western society do the same thing. """

Love this product and my kids love the healthy foods I make with it.
Super good price.  Pens stay nice until you're ready to use them.  Smooth writing on most surfaces and a nice variety of colors.
I bought these pens because the picture shows there being bright green and also brown and neither of those colors are in the package! I do different colors in my planner and NOW I have to go out and buy more pens! I want my money back!

I'm trying to get off of the diet soda, and this is good when I don't want any caffeine, but still want some fizz. It's expensive, but worth it when considering my health."
"When I stumbled across these on amazon, I was super excited.  Once I saw the almost uniformly positive reviews, I got even more excited.  This product gave every indication that I would really like it.  I expected to like it.  I mean, there's hardly a single person that bought this case of sparking juice that wasn't just thrilled with it.Well, let me tell you, I am SUPER disappointed.  I think the people drinking this just don't know what they're doing, or have never had quality beverages before.  These ""juices"" are **ALL** apple juice.  It smells like apple juice, it looks like apple juice, it TASTES like apple juice.  Yeah, sure, maybe there's a splash of grape in the grape one.  Maybe there's a splash of orange in the orange one.  But really, they taste exactly like grape- or orange- or lemon-flavored apple juice.And no surprise, the ingredients list reveals---guess what?  They're mostly apple juice.  You see, folks, when you mix juice with soda water, and you still want it to be acceptably sweet and not add sugar?  There's only one juice sweet enough for that, especially if you want to keep the price down:  Apple.I was hoping it wouldn't be THIS much apple.  I was expecting that the orange would be a somewhat apple-tinged orange...not a somewhat orange-tinged apple.  And so on for the other flavors.So yeah, I was very disappointed.  If you're expecting **ANYTHING** even REMOTELY like Izze soda, for example, then to say you are going to be disappointed is the understatement of the week.Save your money.  At $1/can, I think I overpaid by just about half.  There are any number of other products in this price range that are vastly superior to this.  I can't imagine what all of the folks so excited about this beverage in the other reviews were tasting that I wasn't tasting.It's.  Apple.  Juice.  with bubbles."

"I'm unfortunately ignorant if Methodist vows, but does it say in the rules that you can't marry a homosexual couple?

And, our backyard can get very windy.This Chimney Starter is WONDERFUL!!  It's sooooo simple and easy to start.  Just like the instruction says, you just need some newspaper and charcoal.  Light up the newspaper, and ...it gets a bit smokey but charcoal gets hot!And, after it's poured to the grill bottom, charcoal stays hot.  Our meats and veggies don't taste like lighter fluid, either, haha :DWe're very happy with our purchase!!"
I bet a lot of people do not know about this..

"Like several other reviewers, I got a knock-off product. It did not even arrive in an Amazon box. It was shipped in the product box from China, with address label pasted right on the box. It does not have the Paderno name on it anywhere (as shown on product page). It does not have any brand markings at all. The plastic seemed cheap and flimsy from the beginning and the third time I used it, the handle broke. Looks like an item for the landfill, sadly."
I love that these juices are all natural.  A great alternative to soda and my kids and I enjoy them.
great
An essential item to have if you cook with charcoal.  Works great!

Beautiful pens. My son uses these for spirograph and they work great!
"We're big fans of fizzy beverages and have been trying to get away from artificial ingredients, namely HFCS. I came across The Switch and thought I would give the sampler pack a try. Now I think we're hooked. The flavors are strong - in a good way - no muted fruit juice here. If you're looking for an alternative to pop or soda or want to mix up what you're drinking, I highly recommend giving this a try."
"Game changer, worth every penny."
Great for starting up a Big Green Egg.

"George Stephanopolous did call him out on it yesterday on ""This Week"". Boehner just ignored the question and talked about something else. Right around the 10:40 mark, it starts to get extra infuriating:http://abcnews. go. com/ThisWeek/t/video/week-exclusive-interview-john-boehner-20486985"
"Works great and is bigger than the ones you find at big box stores. Definitely don't fill it all the way with charcoal if you are using a standard sized grill. I use the firestarter cubes with it and the charcoal is ready in 10 - 15 minutes and I mean ready, each piece of charcoal is bright red.  Use a mit to flip out the charcoal into the grill.  The extra handle is a nice feature."
Very good pens. Love them.  Very smooth and the colors are vibrant!!

"I got into charcoal grilling about a year ago. Before that I was grilling with gas. When I first started I used the charcoal in the grill/lighter fluid method . Hated it, taste of my meats were just not right. Researched and came across this little doohickey and have never looked back. Using newspaper or fire starters your coals get going in about 10-15 minutes. Constructed pretty well. Have had mine for about 6 months sitting on my patio. Haven't seen any rust or anything that would tell if this thing was going to break on me soon. Looks and feels like it'll last forever. The handle on it is great and also has a bar so you can easily dump the coals in the grill without feeling awkwardly heavy and burn yourself. The only thing that I could think of that would be a con to some people would be the color around the vent holes change because of the amount of heat from the coals."
"&gt; Republicans have argued that in pushing nominations, Obama is “packing” the court, and have insisted that Obama is trying to tilt the court’s ideological balance in a Democratic direction. I bet a million dollars that if it was a Republican president pushing conservative minded justices, there would be no opposition whatsoever.  Ideological balance?  Fuck them."
"Great product, I just don't use it enough to justify having purchased it."
"I think Kennedy would have defended Bush's Iraq invasion.  He escalated Eisenhower's advisors to Vietnam.  If he was willing to send men to die to fight communism I can easily see him supporting troops going to Afghanistan and Iraq, assuming he believed the ""intelligence"" provided to the UN by Colin Powell."
Fast shipping and a great deal on my favorite pens. I love using them for color coded notes.
"They wouldn't close the plants if an alternative source wasn't in place and it appears they're being replace by natural gas...  cheaper, more efficient, and cleaner.   How is this with complaining about?  One plant closes, another opens with lower operational cost.  Some jobs will be lost, but that happens when your business model fails to be competitive."
"LOVE IT. Only drawback is the suction cups on the legs don't stick as well as they could, but I still love using it and I've recommended it to friends.Good price and easy to clean and store."
"Thank you for this.  I have 3 children, 4, 2, and 2 weeks old and sometimes I wonder if I should stay home and watch mass instead of bringing my ""distractions. "" We have a crying room, and if one of them act up my wife and I will take them their until they calm down.  This gives me a new prespective and is very encouraging."

"These pens barely have a point to them for writing with.  A small ""nib"" pokes out and adds to the difficulty of writing smoothly.  I prefer a pen with a hearty, VISIBLE, nib to it and, this - - being a Papermate product, it never occurred to me that I would even have to consider such an issue.  I do not recommend this to anyone who is particular about the quality of their writing equipment.  To me, a long-time aficionado of such equipment, this is a cheaply made, low-class, set of pens; IMHO an embarrassing shame to the Papermate name ."

That's assuming of course the confession is not made under duress and the killer has a fair trial.Neither of which is guaranteed.
This wouldn't be an issue if he just cited his sources instead of trying to claim that the ideas are his own.  Intellectual dishonestly like this just screams that he (or whoever does his writing) is just being lazy.
I now have both the large and smaller Weber Chimney starters and both have worked flawlessly every time.  Couple pieces of crumpled up newspaper pages and a lighter and hot coals are just 10 minutes away.  Even bought one for a buddy that always used fluid to start his charcoal and he is loving it and will never go back to fluid again.
"What fun!  I love the colors. Great gift to attach to a gift card, too."
"This truly works.  Period.  I have had a dozen or more of these over the years, and when friends come they see me use it and inevitably I give it to them, I wonder if somehow I purchase them in bulk?  ha.  This really works, is easy to use, just fill the top with charcoal, wrinkle up some newspaper or other waste paper and put in the bottom (inside the vents).  Use a match to light the bottom paper and stand it up in your grill and allow enough time for all the coals to ash over, then using a high heat protection glove pour evenly into the bottom of your grill, replace the shelf/grill and begin grilling!  No more frustrated lighting and the fire going out, unevenly lit charcoals or any other of the myriad of problems associated with grilling that any of us who grill much have experienced."
This thing is great.
"Thank you for contributing - I agree!   I think that the more you start to look into the history, the more you realize that there is so much you don't know, and that there are other possible ways of reading passages."

"Personally, I want to see her chair the Senate banking committee.   It's an extraordinarily powerful position, and arguably more powerful than the presidency in the arena of domestic financial reform."
Good drinks
"I think the article made it pretty clear that the influence she holds in the senate could have a far greater influence on policy than what she or anyone could do as president.  The senate as a whole absolutely holds more power than the president and therefore senators who can influence the entire body (or at least a majority) hold a unique power in the government.  Not to mention that her strengths are specifically as a consumer advocate who is tough on Wall Street and banks.  Does that  translate to being a great president?  Not necessarily.  Does it translate to being a great senator?  Absolutely, because you are allowed to focus on a narrower range of interests.  And lastly, while she has great appeal to liberals and progressives, she doesn't exactly have that same appeal all over the country.  Middle of the road voters, the type you need to win presidential elections, still fear the picture that the right is able to pair of people like her.  To be clear: they don't fear her unfiltered policy ideas, they fear the politician that the right would portray her as. So yes, I resoundingly approve of her politics and would rather she stay in the senate.  And I am very sane."

"I am a youth minister.  To some comments in this thread, I'd like to respond.  Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus' day, you're right, it didn't exist.  (And it doesn't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below) Neither did adolescence, and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day.  Now, it isn't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence, quite the opposite.  (Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point [here](http://www. faithformationlearningexchange. net/uploads/5/2/4/6/5246709/ym-doesnt-exist. pdf)) Yes, youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself, is not the church.  Yes, a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service, or making church a carnival so the kids won't leave, or making it a funeral so they won't mess up the church with their hijinks, is bad.  Yes, like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success, youth can be bad.  But there is a theology of youth ministry, thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean (www. kendadean. com) and  Andrew Root (www. andrewroot. org) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations.  Absolutely I think youth ministry MUST be intergenerational.  As pastor, I am facilitator of relationships and member of relationships.  Youth ministry is not the [one-eared Mickey Mouse model](http://www. abpnews. com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/one-eared-mickey. jpg), but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church.  At my church, our youth group acts as small group.  We have our own worship on Wednesday, where they learn to lead and create and engage, to find their voice and get content, and contextualize, but we also do everything the greater church does.  Taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because there's no other option is sad for church kids, and disastrous for unchurched kids.  Youth ministry IS ""letting the children come to Jesus"" I am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth, not a pastor solely for youth.  With someone there to invest in them and relate to them, they have the full access an adult has to someone to disciple them and help them in their journey with God.  Someone who has been to seminary, has made this their life's work, not just someone doing it to ""help out. "" Not that that's the end-all, but it's what our adults get, isn't it?  My teenagers are equipped, they are within the larger church, they are called to be fully Christian, just like adults.  I'm not raising Diet Disciples.  They are given adult mentors from the congregation.  And they are living into that.  Also, quick word on things like ""Divided. "" Divided comes with a lot of theological baggage and is almost predicated on the idea that the youth minister is a usurper of the father's sovereign power over his family as the male leader.  There are many more informed voices speaking on this subject who will raise better objections and questions, and leave us with better answers.  I agree youth ministry must not become a golden calf, but it absolutely exists because of the way culture has designed itself.  It is human person to human person relationship in Christ.  It is not to be just one more problematic segregation in the church, but just because we give it a name doesn't mean it has to something other than just ""ministry. """

"&gt; One example is a patient suffering from sleep apnea-like symptoms.  Years earlier, this patient had a blood gas test that would have confirmed the diagnosis, but the test results were hidden in a hard-to-find section of the medical record.  Without Watson, Mehta says he never would have seen the result. &gt; &gt; ""The system looks for competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms""&gt; &gt; The process for finding that crucial test turns out to be remarkably similar to finding the right answer to a Jeopardy question.  Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams, Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results, then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient's symptoms.  Mike Barborak, a natural language engineer at IBM Research, describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine.  ""It's **language processing** but it's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what's actually being stated,"" Barborak says.  That means looking beyond the words of the diagnosis for a basic sense of how the words fit together, and what each possible diagnosis means.

Worse, medical knowledge tends to go stale within four to eight years.  Meanwhile, free time is a commodity most physician’s have precious little of—five hours a month at most.

"I love it! It is absolutely my favorite kitchen appliance. I hardly use grain-based noodles at all now.I've made several recipes from the Healthy Spiralizer Cookbook, and one recipe I made up myself with it so far. It's very easy to use and the fruit and vegetable noodles have been spectacular. They taste great and they are a lot more filling than I thought they would be. And I don't feel crappy afterwards like I do after stuffing myself with regular pasta or noodles.I don't find it difficult to clean at all. Most of the time, running the blades under a stream of water clears most of the vegetable residue out of it before I even need to touch it with a sponge. You need to be as careful with it as any sharp kitchen knife. But I find cleaning out blenders and food processors more annoying, for example.The suction cups are so-so. They definitely help a lot, but you can't really 100% depend on them to stay in place. This isn't an issue for me because I carefully use my other hand to help steady it. One thing - I can't get them to stay stuck to cutting boards of various materials but I can get them to stick pretty well to a counter-top.The fruit and vegetables can discharge a bit of water or juice as you spiralize them, so it helps to have paper towels or a kitchen towel handy.One thing is when you are getting used to the set-up, be careful the first time you take the blades out of the storage. The very first time I did this I wasn't sure how much pressure to apply and I ended up slightly cutting my thumb. It wasn't much worse than a paper-cut but that is something to think about as you're getting accustomed to it. Now that I know the touch of it, I haven't had any problems at all.I would not recommend using this if you are very clumsy or easily distracted. Just a heads-up. It's a great appliance, but when you're working with it, you need to be mindful and fully mentally present with the task at hand.The picture I attached is of a zucchini noodle chicken soup I made with the spiralizer. It was fantastic and everyone who ate some of it loved it."

"These are perfect!  They are the perfect size for inclusion in my 8 yr old grandson's lunch box; the crisp sparkling juices quench his thirst and aid in digestion; the variety pack allows him to choose a flavor that will complement the daily meal; and the price is right, even after factoring in shipping costs.I love them as much as my grandson does and highly recommend that you give them a try."
I have used this for almost a year and it has worked flawlessly every time. We generally grill at least once a week if not more and this has always worked it starts the coals with minimal paper and effort. It also starts them faster because of its design to funnel the heat onto the next coal and provide plenty of air to the starting coals. The only problem it has is if you have a pretty large grill it might not make enough coals for it we have a thirty inch grill.
awesome for making noodles and cutting out the carbs.
"Exactly what I needed for work, great price and quick shipping:)"
Works great.
So I found a dead fly in my pack of pens and I'm not too happy about that.

"Summary: while this does offer a tasty alternative to soda, I will be sticking to soda because I prefer the taste and soda is 1/6 the cost of this.I am a daily soda drinker and so I decided to give these a try. While they do taste pretty good, and are comparatively healthier than drinking sodas, I do not think I would buy them again at the price point I did (about $1/can). They are about four times as expensive as a can of soda and a third the size of a can of soda (so roughly $0.12/fl oz vs $0.02/fl oz for a can of soda). They also taste sweeter than soda, at least the sodas that I drink, which includes Mountain Dew."

"Just when you write a paper in college, you have to examine the textual evidence. Penn Jillette had a pretty good review of the evidence and he basically said that the mountain of things that Obama has actually said and the fact that he was a member of that Chicago church for so long has to be weighed against speculation.   Sure, he grew up in a secular home, he's exceptionally bright, and there is plenty of political motivation and coercion that would lead someone to fake religious belief for gain, but unless you are a mind reader, you have to base your evaluation on the textual evidence.  I *want* to believe that Obama is actually an atheist, but the evidence says otherwise."
"We're talking about someone who says that literally nobody needs a gun, but she gets armed bodyguards because she's special.  What do you think?"
What can you say about this that hasn't already been said?  Chimney starters are the greatest boon to outdoor grilling since the invention of charcoal.  This is one of the best starters.  It's very large and holds a lot of charcoal.  The handle is far away from the body.  There is a heat shield between the body and the handle.  The wire bail makes dumping the coals easier.  My only nit pick is that the vent holes on the bottom are not large enough to fit a long handled lighter into.  So you have to tip the chimney to light it underneath.  Not really a deal breaker by any means.
Works great.
"Takes a bit too much charcoal when filled to the top.  But, this is a must have for your barbecue."
"These are good pens--my favorite, and pretty much the only kind that I use. Note that the ink does smudge on some items. I noticed this the other day when I tried to write on a USPS printed label. I put a piece of scotch tape over the label so that it wouldn't smudge."
"This is the best way to start a charcoal fire, requires no chemicals for a healthy start."
This is so well worth it. Its big it's perfect. Solid craftsmanship.
I really enjoy certain flavors of these and some of the others I dont quit mind they are very bitter tasting
The Republicans can go fuck themselves.
Easy way to start coals.  No reason not to have it.  If you're concerned that you'll need more charcoal get two.
Amazing ink pens. My inly complaint is that I do not always write with the pen straight up and down. When you write with it tilted it gets a little ink glob. Other than that they are smooth and very easy to use.

Even the flavors that I considered too odd for my palate like the watermelon and kiwi were quite good.  Gluttony gets the better of us and we want them to be bigger, but this size is perfect for calories and sugar grams. I will definitely purchase more of this product."
love it...works great.

There is a reason this machine has gotten such good reviews - because it works GREAT!
"So the solution to that is having constant upward pressure by creating money out of nothing that is constantly inflating, since any deflation is catastrophic?  Because that is often the conclusion of the Keynesian/new economics argument that you began. People need *wealth* to trade for other *wealth. * But when our central banking system is such that new money can be printed to drive down interest rates (allowing companies to expand and raise wages faster than they would otherwise have been able to) and pay for government programs that fall short in budgeting, the balance is thrown off.  There is new money in the system, but the same amount of wealth.  It works great at first, creating a boom.  But eventually the market catches up with the fact that people are trading more paper money for the same amount of *stuff*, and you have a contraction, or a bust. It is often hard to argue against your statement in a populist setting, since what you said is essentially true.  If people have more money, they can spend more money.  But what you have not taken into account is what French economist Frederic Bastiat called ""what is seen and what is unseen. "" I would reccomend reading his essay of the same name and seriously considerin it's implications.  I used to think along the same lines as you until I read it. I would also point out that it is small and medium sized businesses that create jobs.  New businesses are therefore the best path to future job creation.  However you seem to be (possibly indirectly) arguing that demand side limitations is what hinders this.  As someone actively trying to start a business right now, I can tell you that demand side has no effect on my business plan, as I only intend to sell my product for $3-10, which is what I believe the market can handle.  Jumping through all the regulatory hoops is killing me though.  Just one quick example out of many: if I want to set up my business as an LLC in order to secure business loans and give myself a layer of protection, in Massachusetts I have to pay a $500 registration fee.  Then *every single year* after that, I would have to pay an additional $500 fee for the privledge of filing my annual report with the state.  This annual report serves noones bennefit but the states, I might add.  If you want new jobs to be created quickly, remove all the regulations hindering small business development.  And if you don't believe that it's that bad, I would invite you to to ahead and try starting a business yourself."

"I'd never used a chimney before, because my FIL always uses a blowtorch to get his going, and I kind of thought that was silly.  I finally broke down and bought this one, because some food and wine website said chimneys were necessary and this was one of the best.  The first couple of times I used it I was unimpressed because it wasn't lighting.  Eventually, I figured out I wasn't putting enough newspaper under it.  After I stopped skimping on paper, this baby flares up quickly!  I do live in Oklahoma, though, so there's pretty much always a breeze (breezes in OK are defined as 25 mph or less)  :).  In 20 mins or less I generally have blazing coals.  Also, haven't had issue with the handle getting hot, though I'm sure I eventually will.  Definitely follow the instructions, though, and use protective gear when handling (do as I say, not as I do.)"
"Although limited in what it can do, it works exactly as advertised.  It's solid,reliable and reasonably easy to use.  It has a convenient place to store the various blades until used, and while it's not tiny, it fits well in an average kitchen cabinet.  It does exactly what I need it to do."

"along the with the trend of universities doing outrageous things: I had to take a sexual harassment class for like 20 mins before the year.  Everyone takes them and they're a complete waste of time.  Everyone purposefully answers them incorrectly just to fuck with them.

The correct answer was A!!  Are you fucking kidding me?!  In college, you are not innocent until proven guilty; you are most likely guilty until proven innocent.  What the hell?!  I wrote to them and ripped them a new one and they had nothing.  They tried to argue that ""most likely guilty,"" did not imply guilty until proven innocent.  Umm what?!  If I was in a jury and before hearing anything from a case, I said, ""yeah, he's probably guilty,"" How in the fuck is that not implying guilt until proven innocent. Apparently, there's a law that the standard for these incidents is such."
"&gt;Of course, the Obama administration is to blame for the botched rollout, but there are other culprits getting less attention – namely, global tech conglomerate CGI, which was responsible for the bulk of the execution, and in general the ability of big corporations to get massive taxpayer-funded contracts without enough accountability. &gt;Government outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades.  Taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies' pockets, about $80bn of which goes to tech companies.  We've reached a stage of knee-jerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias, and it's damaging in multiple levels. &gt;For one thing, farming work out often rips off taxpayers.  While the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent, time-wasters drooling over their Texas Instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions, studies show that keeping government services in house saves money.  **In fact, contractor billing rates average an astonishing 83% more than what it would cost to do the work in-house.  Hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the US, while contractors, especially in the IT space, can ship taxpayer-funded work overseas. **&gt;Fortunately, then, there are alternatives to outsourcing public functions to big corporations padding their profits at taxpayers' collective expense, and it is time we used them...

"Organic apple juice is dirt cheap, for this price they should be organic, since they're mostly apple juice with a minimal amount of other fruit juices mixed in.If the price were more reasonable I'd buy them, for now a few dollars for 64 oz of shoprite organic apple juice is a better buy. If you need the fizz, buy a carbonator like sodastream, you can fizz up your own water or juice and add organic fruit syrups."
And people who understand math.
Excellent products and fast transaction.
great product. excellent experience. fast shipping.
"I am glad I got the variety pack, because every flavor was good"
Just a perfect fit
Great!
This is NOT great. I got a handheld spiralizer and it works better than this product.
I love these pens.  They write so smoothly and do not smear.
"&gt; Charles and David Koch are both members of the . 00001%.  That’s a group of twenty individuals who **have a total net worth of over a half-trillion dollars, about $26 billion each**. I didn't trust a numerical analysis from someone who things that $52 billion = over half a trillion dollars, so I checked the numbers. Using the figures from the the excel spreadsheet they link to, they gained $12 billion in wealth together ($6 billion each). That's almost $32. 9 million a day, $1. 37 million an hour, $22. 8 thousand an hour, or $381 a second. The article says that the food stamps are for $1. 50 a meal, so per year that's $1. 50*3*365, or $1642. 5.  Therefore, it would take them 4. 3 seconds to feed her for the year if they were to split her food stamps bill. This is absolutely shocking by itself.  Getting the numbers so wrong totally discredits the criticism, though, and that's a real pity. (Note that I'm not checking the base figures that the article provides, but I'm not convinced they're accurate given how careless the author is with the calculations.  Also, if I've made a stupid mistake here, I'd love to know!  If so, I'll confess idiocy and apologise unreservedly! )Edit: I just saw a txt doc that they linked to that says that he's basing it on a 50 week working year and 40 hours a week.  This doesn't make sense to me given that the money gained was an increase in wealth from investments, not salaried income."
These very nice tshirts they keep their shape other cheaper ones seem to stretch out and look sloppy especially the neck and sleeve area.  They also keep their color and do not fade after a few washings.
Plan and simple - this is a MUST HAVE if cooking with charcoal!  Once you use it you will never use charcoal without it again.  All you need is some crumpled up newspaper underneath and voila!
"I love this product! I make oven baked sweet potato fries with it. Healthy and delicious. Easy clean-up, too."
"Scumbags like that wannabe pastor is why people don't wanna trust God and His promises to take care of us.  I am constantly making mistakes, so I'm not at all saying I'm better than him.  However, I hope God either changes that louse or takes away his leadership position before he hurts anyone else!"
"I really enjoyed the variety of flavors in this pack.  I wish that the cans were 10-12oz instead of 8, as sometimes they are just not enough.All of the flavors had a nice taste as they are all easy to drink. I liked the fact that they had the feel of a soft drink, but were really based on fruit juice not flavorings."
&gt;120 percent of the public believes scientists falsify global warming dataWhaa I don't even...
"Yeah I have to say as a moderate that if I saw this slideshow it would shift me to the right. There are useful and detrimental forms of biblical criticism.  Your slide glibly defends them all by painting your opponents as all representing a single position (literalism) and arguing criticism is superior.  Well as a moderate i'm no literalist, but depending what criticism you are talking about, it sure is preferable! Law and Gospel is spread throughout both testaments, sometimes within the same verse, your slide shows a complete misunderstanding of Walther and therefore Lutheranism.  Furthermore, to write off a part of the cannon is Marcionism (an ancient heresy) http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/MarcionismRemember that your pro life brethren understand abortion to be murder.  If you want to try to convince them you are going to need an argument where you can replace the word ""abortion"" for ""murder"" in the argument and it will still be persuasive.  I'm not saying *you* have to believe it's murder, I'm saying you have to know your audience. Actually the issue of homosexuality is not remotely controversial in places where the church is growing like East Asia and North Africa.  It's a major issue in the US and Europe.  Try again without writing off 70% of all Christians in your answer. There are two sides to the final argument, you miss both of them, and presume the problem is that they don't understand the way to accomplish a liberal political agenda is through liberalism. Side 1: The political causes I think are most important are things like addiction recovery, missions to closed countries, and family values, consistent with all the things you named, but represented in this country by the opposite political party as the one this church is supporting. Side 2: I don't think the church institution should be supporting any political agenda at all, I think that is a job for Christians, but not churches, the church has lost focus on the important things (like the sacraments)"
"This is partly my fault because I didn't read the info carefully enough...but I thought this was a low-cal or diet product, but it's not....full octane.  But even so, I don't care for the flavor...has a bitter-ish tart flavor that I just don't care for.  Won't order again."
"What about private schools?  Public school teachers are nice and I think they mean well, but unfortunately political messages are told to the students."
Showed this list to my mom (a conservative Christian who fights for and would have fought for all those things) and got grounded.  Worth it.
"Where do you people live that you get visits from evangelicals so many times in such a short span of time? I've lived in the south much of my life, and I think I've been accosted a total of five times, ever, all with years in between. At least three of those five were while walking through a college campus.   Only two were door knocks."
"yup..  if they really didnt think it would work, they should it pass..  and let it ""fail""... they would get the house, senate and presidency."
"&gt; If there are other laws that do, that has nothing to do with Obamacare. You should read the article.  Second paragraph:&gt;The 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), known as the Motor Voter law, says that DMVs and other state agencies that provide public assistance have to provide voter registration services. The reason the PPACA is involved is because it creates new federal and state agencies that provide public assistance. &gt;Besides, why is it Bad to encourage people to vote? High voter turnout usually results in elections going against Republicans.  This is why they try so hard to disenfranchise voters every election cycle."
I received this item broken. I rigged it to work so I wouldn't have to deal with sending it back.
Random and semi-relevant: Mark Warner used to be governor of Virginia and almost everyone loved him.  I lived in a strongly republican part of VA and they had nothing bad to say about him.  They were all mad he didn't run for president in '08.
Bought these for my sister for Christmas.  She uses them a lot.  And she loved these.  Perfect
"The supple cotton feels so soft, it's like you are wearing kitten fur.The pocket is purrrfect for holding a pencil, or bag of catnip."
I do love my chimneys.  I don't use any other starter for charcoal.  I cringe when I see people using lighter fluid.
"Chrome seems to be minimalistic for the sake of being minimalistic, its almost as annoying as the super pushy tie-in to Google 'services'. To me FF is where it's at."
I like this and think it is worth the money.  You do have to use smaller pieces of vegetables in order for it to work comfortably but that's fine by me.  I just cut cucumbers and zucchini's in half before I spiral them.  It's simple to clean up after using and takes very little storage space.  I'd recommend to anyone looking to get rid of the bigger bulkier spiral slicers like I was.
Has the carbonation of soda but its 100% juice. The kids love it.
My kids love this drink. They had it in school and i decided to buy it for them.  Need to reorder
"Great product!!!! My second one, to use with the first.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!"
"Yeah, the notion that any party would die is pretty absurd anyway, in the end you just have constituencies shuffle around a bit but the ""Republican"" and ""Democrat"" parties won't go anywhere anytime soon. I do think that the Tea Party could die as a result of this though, or at least be cut off from the mainstream Republican party that they have latched onto.   The problem is that the fringe Tea Party members in the public seem to think that they really are the majority, but since they aren't they're likely to overstep the bounds of public opinion like they are currently doing with the shutdown over ObamaCare.   The mainstream Republicans are trying to bail them out right now to cover their own ass but I think once the Republicans lose the next presidential election due to all the infighting in their party spurred on by the Tea Part that they will stop placating the Tea Party and start fighting it for real.   If they're smart they could shun the Tea Party and make them the right wing party to the Democrat's left wing party while presenting the classic mainstream Republican party as the moderate party."
I've gotten lazy in my dotage and don't use this nearly enough. But when I do use it its fun!
Works Great!  Highly recommend.  A must for all charcoal grillers/smokers!
bigger size works great
good
I have had mine for 4 years and it sits outside on my24/7. through rainstorms and glaring sun/...... We BBQ every Sunday so this thing is heavily used. Honestly it it probably the best Amazon item I have purchased. Used it hundreds of times and it is still strong and sturdy. Highly recommended....
I like these
"The Switch is absolutely delicious and disappears quickly in this house! I admit they are a bit pricey, but since they are composed of mostly fruit juice I guess that is to be expected. I have always been a soda drinker and have been trying to quit drinking it since it is so unhealthy and am happy to report that the Switch completely satisfies my soda cravings. I only wish this product were available in 16 oz. cans or bottles."
"This spiralizer is so much fun and easy to use.  It also makes frying vegetables a breeze since they are cut so thinly.  I made the best topping for burgers yesterday by using the ribbon blade and cutting  an onion into a thin strip and they sauteing it.  You can use this for garnishing dishes beautifully, making vegetables look more interesting to kids to get them to eat them or to cook veggies more rapidly.I am concerned that when the blades wear out I won't be able to replace them.  I'll probably purchase another two of these so I won't have to worry about not having one in the future."
Easy to use and cuts great! Would highly recommend.
"I read the introduction --&gt; It is very interesting so far.  I like how page 3 points out how riddiculous the accepted story is, really funny page :)That said it seems to be pretentious ""This is the truth... "".  I'll read more to find out if the rest makes sense.  Thanks for sharing anyway."
Best choice in charcoal chimneys in my opinion. This thing is extremely well made with thick metal. I barbecue 2-3 times a week. This thing holds up to the weather and heat from the charcoal like none other.
Wow. Why have I not used these pens sooner.The write smooth and the colors are great. These are my go to pens now.
A fantastic way to start a BBQ. Easy to use and it fires up the coal fast
Totally agree with this:&gt; Not all Republicans are modern racists but it seems that all modern racists are Republican.
I really tried hard not to laugh out loud at this at work.   I didn't succeed.
Excellent
"Very good AND they go fast, fizzy fruity (apple mostly as above) but...small and too many calories"
"Fuck that, expand! How do you think the financial crisis didn't turn into another Great Depression?  Almost the entire world uses Dollars as their peg / reserve currency.  What the US says is reality becomes reality. The necessary step we need to take next is colonizing the moon and mars."
"I don't wish it on America but I honestly think that until generations suffer from a kind of oppression they will do nothing to prevent it.  we had a generation oppressed in this way.  They got tired of it.  They changed things.  They taught their children to understand the importance of that change.  Those children taught their children about it but it was a generation removed.  Then those children sort of forgot about it, feeling that progress was made and now those things needn't be worried about.  So those children didnt really teach their children about it at all.  And now we have a generation that has forgotten entirely.  History may be cyclical for that reason.  Sadly, change takes more generations and if the union system vanishes now, it will be quite some time before workers can be free and safe again.  So, no, I don't wish it on us -but it may also be inevitable."
"Agreed. Bet your own fucking paycheck, Boehner."
I love the material
there excellent
not heavy duty but works very well
"A very efficient Spiralizer, easy to use, the results are great."
"I'm in love with this product. I really only use the smallest size blade, but will continue to experiment. We now have a bowl of zoodles in the fridge at all times and eat them lots of different ways. One of my favorite things is that cutting an onion is now sooo easy for me. I just spiralize it super fast! Before, my eyes would burn and tear up so I couldn't even. Tomatoes and mushrooms don't work though! That gave my bf a good laugh when I just had to try and tomato juice squirted all over the room and the mushrooms squished. Lol. Anyway, this is my favorite kitchen appliance!!!"
Beautiful colors. Smooth writers. Fun. Of course you don't need eight different tints of ink but isn't it a joy to find reasons to use all of them? For eight bucks you get 24 easy flowing ball point pens; shoot you could spend that much on just one pen that doesn't write as well as these InkJoys. I bought them on a lark but now I hand them out and spread the Joy (literally and figuratively). Now I'll probably buy them just to pass out Joyously.
"This message needs to get out more. As it sits, the propaganda of the lamestream media has been successfully painting the right as ""angry white people"" as opposed to the ""soccer moms"" of the left."
Love them but wish they did not have the wax like ends that have to be removed to start writing. Annoying bits. The colors are pretty good but the light blue often looks like the green when next to one another. They write smooth but lines are fairly thick and I would be happier with a bit narrower despite being medium yes....
That's how I feel about the idiots in La Raza.  Don't come here if you want to turn us into the shithole you just left.
"To be honest, as a biracial person (black dad, white mom) living in the Midwest, I've never encountered any bigotry unique to my circumstance.  Most of the time I'm treated just like any other person, but when I do encounter racism, I'm just treated like any other black person.  Never met a racist with a special brand of racism just for me. Of course, that's not to say that they don't consider the origins of my conception and are repulsed by the thought..."
I finally found  something that really works without costing the earth!! I can finally make my zucchini spaghetti without any hassles!!I definitely recommend it if you are looking to buy one!!
I don't believe that I would except another box of these pens if there were free.  I never had to work so hard to use a pen in my life.  They all came with a orange hard product on them that you have to remove and you have to screw them all together before you can use them.  I wondered what was going on when I tried to pick up the first pen and only the first half came up an the ink application fell out and then I tried another one and it was so loose that I had to re-screw it and that was the case with all of them.  I WILL NEVER DO THIS AGAIN!!!
Outstanding article.
"They also view it as a one way street and decry the ""war on Christmas"" so you know its also bullying christians to disagree with them too."
The only people offended by the Redskins are white liberals and Obama.
Great pens!!!
does he think that maybe a good president would have worked to change the bill to make it more acceptable to both sides?  that way he wouldn't have to lie about it.
"I was SO happy when I was able to buy this drink on Amazon.  No store or club around me carries it, and I don't like the idea of paying over $1.30 for ONE at the school.  Kids love them!!!"
"Social conservatives want it both ways.  They want women to stay home, to not use bc, to not vote, to stfu.  Then they don't want to help those women, complain that they have too many kids, complain about ""who is raising"" their kids, want to get rid of the minimum wage and on and on.  Every time one of them tells me about big government my immediate retort is ""yes, big government *is* a problem; they are in my *cooch* and in my bedroom"" shuts them up right off."
"Family loves all the Switch drinks we've tried, including this Apple flavor.  Better than sodas - 100% Juice with a little carbonation - how can you go wrong? Wish we could buy smaller packs & locally, but at least we can get them on Amazon."
Well worth the purchase
"Works well, however, it has a ton of parts. While compact, it takes some work to figure out how to get it all back together."
"I gave up soda and have been looking for a replacement fix when I want a fizzy drink. This stuff has been great. All natural and tastes really good. I usually go with the variety pack so I can change things up, and really because all the flavors are so good. I definitely recommend these drinks to anyone!"
"The Switch is the best sparkling juice I've ever had, and I've tried every one I know of. I love the variety of flavors they offer. I serve it at parties and gatherings. There's enough choices to please everybody. I've been subscribed to Switch for a year or so and plan to continue. I love it!"
This story makes no mention of the 2013 election and only once mentions Hassan Rouhani!   I mean wtf it's not like there is only side on a negotiation table.   Its like when conservatives credit Ronald Reagan with the end the cold war without a mention of Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms Perestroika and Glasnost.  I think having a more moderate leader in Iran is a bigger reason for progress with them then anything any secretary could do.
"And also, do people forget Bush already?  I know he had some terrible progressive policies in office but before he ran, he was definitely viewed as a strong conservative.  He had that Texas mentality, southern draw, supported low taxes, strong on defense, etc.  Even with the media constantly attacking him, he still won reelection.  And don't forget Reagan.  Go look up his 2nd presidential numbers and see how many electoral votes he got.  You'll think its a typo."
"This beverage is a excellent blend of fruits with just enough sparkle. I rate the taste and marketing five stars. I was starting to drink pepsi and coke many times throughout the day. Flat drinks become boring fairly quickly and having a can of The Switch easily takes the craving of a soda away. Although this drink does contain a large amount of sugar, it does not contain other harmful ingredients found in coke such as acid. My review does not refelct the price of the beverage. I believe it is overpriced for 8 ounce cans, but some may find with how easy it is to stop drinking soda, the price is suitable. There are many other beverages out there but if you are considering The Switch furit punch flavor, I would highly reccomend it."
"I have 3 teenagers still at home.  I bought SWITCH as a treat to drink from time to time; something that's good for us and helps keep us drinking in the hot weather.  We don't drink much soda when we're in a country with potable water, and sometimes glass after glass of cold water gets boring.  We all prefer to avoid sweetened drinks.  SWITCH has turned out to be a very nice thing to have in the house.  We have the variety pack, so there's always a new flavor.  We feel good about what we're drinking.  It is, however, VERY SWEET.  One of my daughters complains that it is too much so, and she puts a few ice cubes in to dilute it.  I find that we all feel as if we've had a dessert after drinking it, so no one is looking for cookies or whatever if there's SWITCH after a meal--a nice bonus."
"The best way to start a charcoal grill!  The Weber does the job well. Don't have experience with other brands, but no need to look further, this one is sturdy, but more importantly, gets the coals hot!"
Nice.
"I agree with you - the stronger the middle class, the better for our economy.   The Democrats support the middle class and help the lower class with food and shelter.   The Republican support of corporations and the rich help only a select few."
Great shirts.
These shirts are quality items.  The fit is good and the material is heavy. After 3 washings the shirts have not shrunk.
Really nice pens.  The ink goes on very smoothly which minimizes the hand strain.  All of the colors are legible; I have had problems with other pens having ink that is too light.
"Ted Cruz was only elected because his opponent, the Perry Machine pick, was horribly incompetent.   He is legit crazy, and he knows that crazy is all he can muster politically because the GOP machine wants to burn him alive."
"I'm always looking for t-shirts with pockets and this shirts seems to be perfect for my use. They do run a bit large, but then they are 100% cotton, so I expect some shrinkage. This is not a shirt you would wear for show, but one you would wear when gardening and want a heavy weight shirt that will cover everything. The quality of the material seems to be fairly heavy so that's another thing I like. Be careful as some of the shirts are Prime and others charge shipping. It depends on which color you choose."
"cant imagine charcoal bbq/grilling without it. works perfectly every single time. just gotta give it about 15minutes to work. Don't give up on it after the first 5 minutes. Let it do its thing, it'll get it going."
"Scumbags. As with all religions, this one will die one day.  My only regret is that I will likely not be alive to see that day."
"I usually don't like listening to Limbaugh, but every now and then he articulates a point so perfectly.  This is one of those times."
I wanted to like it... but I and the kids did not like. I am not sure what it was... nobody seemed to like the taste
Nice mix
These retractable pens are great in writing that;s why our family uses it.
great price
"God was decided decades ago as ambiguous as to not pertain to a specific religion, of course if it was In Jesus Christ we trust, then you'd have an argument.  So in essence, Mr.  Concern troll, get dunked"
"This is such an excellent little sermon, thanks for posting it. The Reformation really isn't something to boast about, at least not yet.   And it's far from over.   If we don't think our institutional disunity is a scandal and threatening to our salvation, then we've missed a large part of what Jesus is about."
good
"This is the slickest contraption ever invented!  it used to take a couple hours with constant fretting, to get the coals ready for cooking.  My husband opted always for gas grilling because of this.  However, with this gadget, it takes no more than 1/2 hour, and WITHOUT starter fuel! I can't imagine grilling without it now."
"Worked well at first and after using it several times, the suction cups no longer attach to the surface."
"This is a very good grilling utensil!!!! I couldn't stand  that lighter fluid taste on food and with this starter, you don't need it! As long as they make these, I won't ever go back to using lighter fluid again."
"Smooth writing, great bright colors. Love the price for the number of pens you receive."
I will always maintain that giving these people so much money is insane.  Make them send their kids to public school and see how fast our education system would improve.  Make them take the same public transportation as the rest of us and see how quickly things improve.  You can't serve a public you are so detached from on a basic day to day level.
Transparent hucksterism.  And his son has learned well.  Ted Cruz is the Tiger Woods of conservative hucksters.

"From Alabama, race you!"
"These juices are wonderfully refreshing, slightly tart, with no added sugar or fructose.  Just fruit juice concentrates, sparkling water and vitamin C.  And they're smaller cans than most sodas, so your child isn't filling up on liquid.  Just 120 calories and 5 mg of sodium in an 8 ounce can."
I love it for camping.
Very good - great vivid colors.
Does what it's supposed to do: light coals.  Every 'quer should own this.
"I have ordered this product 3 times for my son, it has always been deliveredin less than a week from the order date.  Good value for the money, andit is actually good for you.  All flavors are good, and it's nice having the variety.Definitely will continue to order this product."
Love this thing. Started whole 30 vegetarian diet and it has saved me on meal prep a few times. worth it even if you just make zuchinni noodles. I like that it comes with three blades.
Fantastic and fun!
"While this does a decent job of making noodles from veggies, I was really surprised upon opening it about how cheap it is! It is made of very light plastic and the handle feels as if it could break off at any time. The core of every vegetable is taken out, whether you want it to be or not and it definitely doesn't work on harder veggies. I will use it until it breaks, as I spent $30 on it (which it isn't worth) but I wouldn't purchase it again."
Works like a charm. Never fails to get a pile of coals going. Use this almost every weekend for firing up the smoker.
"This was my first Carhartt Shirt I bought online. So far the fit looks/feels fine, and as expected. These shirts come in a larger selection of colors compared Wayne with the Riggs Pocketed Ts."
Love this!
"I simply love these Retractable Medium Point Ballpoint Pens, Assorted. I have even given them away as gifts to my friends. I do not believe that there is another pen that writes as smooth as the Paper Mate InkJoy 300 RT Retractable Medium Point Ballpoint Pen.I first noticed them on TV and the way they were advertised, I thought I just had to have one, so I ordered them on-line.Your friend,Sandy"
"My son absolutely loves these sparkling juices, but the price is absurd!"
Let us be clear here - it is do-nothing Republicans.  I'm so goddamn tired of the 'both sides are equally bad' line.  Total bullshit.
fun to stock the fridge before parties.
I'm fat and need something to cover my belly. So says my wife. This does it. I got the for work now there all I wear. lol my wife hates that too!
"Absolutely love these pens! Great quality at a great price! These are perfect for any college student, they do not smudge."
It is exactly as described.
Pens are constantly drying out after use
"Highly recommended for BBQ lovers! It is the first time I use such a tool to start charcoal fire, but I must say it is a great invention just because it simplifies and accelerate the task time. Put the chimney starter in your clean BBQ and inside the starter put fire starter paper and charcoal and let it burn until you get red ashes that you just pour into your BBQ, that it is. It is made of great quality brushed stainless steel. I was impressed by the size, but it is logical as it is conceived to fit any 22.5 diameter BBQ. Weber is Weber, it is good quality and this product makes no exception. A great deal especially if you take the price in consideration!"
"If you look at some of the quotes from the groups (certainly the ones I've read from the AFA and FRC), no Christian should be saying those things.   They are untrue and malicious, never mind downright paranoid and xenophobic."
I read that thing awhile back..  Really blows stuff out of proportion.
"This is a very dangerous situation.  In all the countries where fascism took over, it did so at a time of left-wing ascendancy.  The Tea Partiers will only continue to participate in elections if they can win them.  Once they start losing, if they follow the fascist pattern, they will begin seriously calling for violence.  Then we have our Kristallnacht, and who knows where it goes from there. I seriously hope I'm out to lunch on this one."
Very good.
Best kitchen tool...
Great charcoal starter.  2 pieces of newspaper and a light and you've got a ready to go grill.
works great
"A friend recommended this to me, and I got it as a gift for my mother. She really enjoys it. It works best with firm vegetables like zucchini or squash, cucumbers got a but mushy, and pears didn't work at all.Pros:- Affordable option for spiralizing- Creates awesome zucchini noodels that are a great substitute for pasta- Sharp blades, cuts cleanlyRoom for improvement:- It would be nice if there were grooves or a track that pulled the veggies towards the blades, like old timey' apple peelers have. On this, you have to maintain pressure towards the blade to get a consistent cut, otherwise you are turning the crank for nothing.- The item was a bit too light weight and plastic-like, I felt like I could break the handle if I cranked too hardOverall, its a good supplemental kitchen accessory for creating fun and healthy meals. I would recommend this product to other people."
Buy a bottle of your favorite juice and a bottle of carbonated water instead. This is carbonated apple juice. It doesn't matter what flavor you try it all tastes like Apple juice with a hint of something else. It's not good and it's very expensive. I find it surprising that there are so many positive reviews.
Can't wait for Season Two.
Same great quality Carhartt always delivers. Very eased!
Way too big! Medium fits like and extra large.
Blue InkJoy is smoother but black is a good product
"Yet at the same time, through God ALL things are possible.  I take that as I'm able to handle anything that comes my way through my faith in God and the fact that He is literally 'with me'."
"This is a high quality chimney starter. I will never again use charcoal lighter fluid. Just wad a couple news sheets in the bottom, dump in some charcoal and light the paper with a match. Works like a charm! So glad to discover these..."
"quick starter, works great."
"I wish I could get my money back. I'm writing this review so that if anyone is like myself and thinks they can save a few dollars by purchasing this brand over the Izze brand, don't do it. These flavors taste awful! I tried to ""share"" them with friends and family members, but everyone thought they were bad. I will finally have to cut my losses and just throw them out or donate them. I saw another review and agree completely, ""I  do not understand the 5-star reviews of these nasty-flavored cans of apple- and grape-juice, they just taste awful."""
Works nice
Didn't really like the taste and a lot of sugar. I will not be buying this product again.
"I love this clip sooo much, because she just nails it!  :D I smile every time."
"I adore The Switch, and yes -- my taste buds work just fine. The drinks are all natural, no added sweetener, sparkling water, with an apple juice base. Apple juice, BTW, is THE healthiest juice out there, according to my nationally renowned pain management specialist. Apple juice tastes great to me anyway, and the flavors on the cans ARE what the drinks taste like. Unless you sit there and convince yourself that all you should taste is apple juice, your drinks will taste like what they're advertised to taste like. I had to find a healthy carbonated alternative to pop, and I found it!  I alternate between The Switch and Izze. I love them both; The Switch is somewhat less acidic for the times when my acid reflux isn't playing nice. I have zero complaints, and have The Switch on my Subscribe and Save. My pain level has diminished from diet change, including the switch to The Switch!"
"For ~$202, fuck that price.  I love the shoes, but 200 is just fucking stupid.  For 200, they better personally deliver my shoes in bubble wrap to my bedside."

"Not sure what the challenge is with simply producing a standard ""large"" tshirt that's a few inches longer. This is what I would expect from a ""Large Tall"". Based on the selection on Amazon and elsewhere, it seems like there's a business opportunity out there. I purchased a large tall and got something that's as much wider as it is taller. Kinda feels like wearing window drapery. I hoped the shirt would shrink like all of my regular large tshirts have--it didn't. Not impressed."

"I should have read all the reviews before buying these drinks.  they are not good.  they make you even more thirsty than what you started off as.  Snapple is so much better and cheaper.  they pretty much all taste the same, like apple juice but diluted."
Do you think there are democrats that would rather default on the nation's debt than repeal the ACA?   Would you call them out as traitors?

Great tasting juice my children love them order some for my daughter to take to college with her. I gave it a five thumbs up

"This is a heavy duty, quality made shirt.  I have some long sleeve versions of this shirt and love them.  These are no different (except for the sleeves!).  I will likely keep a few of these in my dresser from now on!This is NOT a tight fitting soft T-shirt like most of the stuff you buy today.  It's a durable slightly baggy shirt.  I am 5'7"", 220Lbs guy and I buy the 2XL of this.  It fits me perfect for my tastes.  Baggy enough to be comfortable and not hugging me but not so big I am swimming in it or that it would cause a hazard at work.I like the pocket for the looks but I don't know how useful it would be.I have washed it many times now and it has not gotten any pills on it at all."
works like a charm.
"Each day I feel the distance between me and any religion increase.  What a horrible, horrible plague on the world it is.  How anyone can ever defend religion blows my mind.  Comforting for individuals, yes, binding communities together, sure...  but the insanity, the violence, the discrimination, the backwards thinking, the warfare, the murder, the child rape?  How anyone can even think to come up with excuses for those things is completely beyond me."

"As usual there's some idiot making this argument:&gt; ""I don't believe the government should have to tell me I have to buy any insurance,"" said Joshua Lucas of Arizona, a stay-at-home father of two.  ""I'm 34 years old, and I am in great health, so I don't feel like I have to have it. ""That's great that you don't feel like you have to have it, but if you end up in the ER and have no insurance then other people end up paying those bills.  It's not a choice you get to make because it impacts other people directly.  If you have at least an extra $250,000 lying around to cover an emergency then I'd say you have some room to make that argument, but something tells me Joshua the stay-at-home father of two does not have that kind of money saved up for emergencies."

so so good product.
"*UPDATED*I originally gave 2 stars. However, I have now dropped it to 1 star. After sending back the first 2 I purchased because the sizing was WAY off I reordered even before being refunded. Now again I will be returning. This time just one of them, but none the less it's a real inconvenience.1st. I ordered a navy and ash shirt. The navy color was as expected. The ash on the other hand was not ash it was very light heather grey. Tag shows ""Ash"" it is clearly heather.2nd. They are still big for being ""Small"" the navy shirt made in Honduras seems to be closest to the medium shirts I normally wear hopefully after a wash it shrinks.The ""Ash"" shirt seems like a large/extra large and again is heather grey made. This one made in Haiti. It's not the fit I wanted nor the color so I will be returning AGAIN.Overall my rating is based on experience as well as the fit and product description.*ORIGINAL POST*2 stars because, the 2 I ordered were massive. I ordered medium size shirts and got medium size shirts according to the tag. All the shirts and even jackets I own are medium size. They were more like large maybe even XL in size. I returned them and ordered the small. Crossing my fingers that they fit otherwise returning them also. The hassle to return something and wait for a refund is the reason it got 2 stars. The quality seemed fine to me and the colors were true."
nice price good pen

"I had another brand chimney starter that I thought was fine, if not great. My mistake left it out exposed to the elements which caused some rust and damage to the wooden handle. I purchased the Weber one as a replacement. Wow. Superior in every way. First it's larger than the average one you find in the stores, the bottom is a heavy wire concentric circle grate instead of stamped metal with holes making for much, much more airflow and better access for the starting fire. The metal seems a slightly heavier gauge, the Handle is some form of plastic or composite, much more durable than wood, and the extra folding handle make it much safer and easier to carry and dump the charcoal as well ass better control in dumping the charcoal right where you want it. Superior in every way to my previous one."
Great way to start your charcoal
Smooth writing.  Love the colors.  Would purchase again.  Worth the money.
"It looks cool, but the taste is too sweet and get shi**y after you drink it to the end. Wont get it again although good for price and you get a lot."
"Easy to use and clean!  I bought this for my mom for Christmas, and she liked it very much.  It certainly helps in maintaining a better diet when you can make pasta out of vegetables like zucchini and daikon."
"These are very nice. The colors are bright and the ink writes as smoothly as advertised (shocking, I know)!"
Holds more charcoal and starts much faster than your standard chimney due to the holes in the sides.

"Former insurance lawyer here:it's entirely possible that the insurance would only cover the fair market value of the destroyed equipment.   That's often substantially less than the replacement cost, because the fair market value of a 5 year old computer is pretty low, but you can't easily buy a 5 year old computer as a replacement.  Other things could have happened as well."

"Switch carbonated juice is a delicious and healthy alternative to soda. I enjoyed every flavor in the variety pack. My only complaint is that the cans are so small (8 oz.) that by the time you really start to enjoy, you're finished. Needless to say the case only lasted me about a week. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to kick the soda habit and likes their refreshment in small doses."
Works great. Sadly I saw the same product in the store today for half the price. Not sure that I would purchase it again.
"I like that it doesn't feel cheap the way most t-shirts do these days. It's cut large for an XL t-shirt, which is a good thing. I just wish it didn't have that annoying brand tag on the pocket. Probably would pay 50 cents or a buck more to not have it there."
"I read that in Joey Mousepad's voice, except saying ""intragnisent""."
"The poll is not as indicative of  the public's view on his policies as much as we'd like to think.   When viewed in the context of congress' low approval ratings (10 percent? ) this poll is more indicative of people disliking their dysfunctional government.   The reason that the number is that high is due to his base supporting his policy positions, regardless of his ability to implement them.   He can simply blame republicans, and as long as republicans continue a political strategy that makes them appear that they're not willing to compromise, he can call them a bully, and continue to have high polling numbers."
"Also, it's sort of intellectually dishonest to say this is a republican only game."
Good on the EFF for calling out the NY Times for being the frequent scumbags and corporate lackeys that they are. That paper has gone so far downhill in the last 20 years or so its pathetic.

"I agree on principle, as an Illinoisan.   One of my college roommates, at the time, was on Obama's senate campaign, as an intern.   I got to hear all about him and how he'd be a great senator for Illinois.   4 years later, he quits his job before he finishes a single term, which was mostly spent campaigning for President."
I'm not sure how I feel about his theology but I wouldn't take how many feathers he ruffles too seriously until you at least look deeper than I have into what he says and how he justifies it.
"Don't use your barbecue without one of these. Best way to light charcoal without using lighter fluid hands down. I prefer to use it inside the barbecue FYI, that way you don't char your grass or patio."
My husband loves these
"Holy. Cow. This is the best way to get the grill going EVER.You don't need lighter fluid, or those pre-soaked bags of charcoal. You don't need nearly as much charcoal as you would usually use. Seriously, all you need is a handful of charcoal and a little crumbled up newspaper. Light the paper up, and voila! Super hot coals (in a fraction of the time it used to take), all going chemical-free. Winner!"
Love these pens...they flow so beautifully.  Priced very well. I even bought an extra pack to give my Goddaughter as an addon \birthday gift.

"Perfect tshirt for tall men.Im 6'8,117 kilos,it just fits fine,I like it allot."
I will never look at vegetables the same way again! Very easy to operate and clean-great product!
I assume it's because the secret service still uses some of the same tactics for securing a location.
I was a bit skeptical of this product but now that I have it I would hate to smoke without it. It really does work with very little newspaper or scrap paper and gets the charcoal red hot. I continue to use it throughout the cook to keep hot glowing coals to feed the smoker.
"These pens work well.  Some colors I may never use because they're too light (or too girlie! :D)  However, I like to use different colors at times in my studies and these work well.  Did I mention that they write like a dream?  These write effortlessly.  Reminds me of the old school Papermate pens that won everyone's business so long ago."
People with negative personal history will take advantage of the easy fix of saying they found religion.
"I'm kind of skeptical. The question is about school kids specifically.  A lot of schools have a Confederacy-related mascot, so many might interpret the question to be about official school clothing."
Awesome.  Kids love them.  So do I :)
Do not buy these pens! At least you wanna use each of them for only ten minutes and throw it to trash.
Can't tell ou anything because this was a gift.
ok

Heavy duty...like the extra length
"This product is HYPER-sweet; I loved them, but other people didn't like them at all."
"Nice pen, writes smoothly with a fine point, so I'm able to write smaller when I need to (which is often)!"
"I believe in paying for quality tools. I got a dutch oven recently and needed a chimney. This one was more expensive but highly rated.WOW!!!Just a couple sheets of newspaper and 10 minutes later the coals are glowing hot and ready.Someone mentioned using Kingston charcoal but I decided to get the cheapest I could find at the grocery store. Yup, it worked great. I needed to use more briquettes though because they were small.Yes, I was kind of doubtful because past experience has proven to me that charcoal needs lighter fluid to light properly. I won't be doing that again.CONSTRUCTIONThis thing is built very well. The heat shield worked very well, and I was happy to have the handle which helps in dumping out the coals. The joints are welded well, and the quality of the metal is high. This is good because it is going to get very hot.NOTE #1: The side of the chimney will discolor due to the extreme heat. This is normal, so don't expect it to look as good as the picture after using.NOTE #2: After dumping the coals, do not set it down on something that can burn or melt. The metal will still be very hot."
The shirt was what I expected.
No more lighter fluid!!
i guess people are going to say it doesn't look like the pic which it doesn't. but if you read the reviews you would see what it looks like. I didn't mind the way it looked in the reviews. It was a lot of pens for a good price. they write smoothly and don't leave blobs of ink. and they are really cute. I am happy with this purchase. although the green color feels a bit cheap.
Libertarians are the mirror image of communists.   Their entire belief structure is based upon a utopian fantasy that cannot exist in reality.
I think this is just one more way that the media tries to belittle atheists.  Who tries to pretend the person they're angry at doesn't exist?  Children.

"I am so sick and tired of the whole ""media cabal"" bullshit excuse.   The notion that the solution to the supposed problem is to fire 90% of editors and hire ones you ""can't control"" is just plainly stupid.   There are surely sources of news that are better than others.   If you rely on 24-hour cable news channels like CNN, MSNBC and Fox News as your sole sources of news, then yes - you deserve constant ridicule.   If you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you, you deserve being ignored.   If you get all your political news from one political perspective, you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a fact-oriented discussion.   Those people are the problem.   They're the ones that resort to making claims of ""mainstream media bias"" which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion.  But what about us readers who rely on SEVERAL sources to make our conclusion!?   On Syria for example, I read the Washington Post, Guardian, Reuters, AP, al Jazeera, CNN. com and several other sources.   I heard about the Administrations' claims of intelligence implicating the Syrian regime, of Putin's claims that it was the rebels, I followed the U. N. 's report findings through the Washington Post.   I followed the story as Obama brought it to Congress, the pros/cons, the opinion polls, arguments for and against a strike, the videos of children dying from the Sarin.   I am more informed these days than ever before, so this disgruntled guys claims ring hollow.   He just comes across as some pissed off guy.   A cynic without a compelling argument. The point is, I am grateful for all these news sources and am not convinced by indignant people like Hersh that they're all ""in the pockets of Obama. ""  Let me ask you this Mr.  Hersh:  what publication is your shining example of journalism?   You sure as hell didn't say.   Who sets the standard on reporting excellence? Well, the Guardian lends you credibility by noting **your Pulitzer Prize. **  You're one of the good guys.   So who else is winning this prestigious prize in the area of International Reporting (that he later derides in the article)?   From the past decade:* 2013 - NY Times* 2012 - NY Times* 2011 - NY Times* 2010 - Washington Post* 2009 - NY Times* 2008 - Washington Post* 2007 - Wall Street Journal* 2006 - New York Times* 2005 - LA Times and Newsday* 2004 - Washington Post* 2003 - Washington Post* 1970 - Dispatch News Service (Seymour M.  Hersh)So my two most preferred publications (NYT &amp; WP) dominate the Pulitzer prize for international reporting.   Fire 90% of these editors!?   It's trite nothingness.   Any fool can cast stones at an entire profession, but how about he put his money where his mouth is and call out some articles, some editors, some authors?   He indicates a systemic problem but can't even get close to substantiating it! Seriously, those who agree with Mr.  Hersh - what news source is your beacon of truth?   What organizations and people are the standard bearers that the rest of the ""pathetic"" media should aspire to be?   I really want to know, because this type of bullshit generalization is a cheap and empty tactic."
"What a condescending, pretentious little brat.  I am neither old nor white, but I think there's plenty of room in the Republican Party for values-voters who are firm in their convictions and believe that an age-old, hallowed vestige that has survived for over a millenia - and is, as Pat Buchanan would have it, the cinderblock of every good civilization - should not be reconstructed or demolished without so much as the batting of an eyelash. For every Jon Stewart-worshipping, dope-smoking millenial we mesmerize with our modernistic, reinvented, ""new and improved"" charms, we lose a folksy, tradition-revering, flag-waving Hank Hill or Charlie church-going, evangelical Christian.  Is this shallow-minded, shortsighted, moral degenerate really going to allow the Cultural Marxists, who have already been permitted to hijack every major institution in sight, to frame the debate for us, rather than fight in the trenches for the divinely ordained, sacrosanct moral order that holds society together?  There's a reason heteronormative marriage has withstood the test of time: dual gender parenting - a mom and a dad - provides a balanced, ""best of both worlds"" approach to the upbringing of our youth.  It sows the seeds and lays the groundwork for ordered liberty, civil government, and moral restraints on the insatiable appetite for avarice and sin.  It is where division of labor, separation of responsibilities, disciplinary action against unruly behavior, unwritten codes of conduct, a rugged work ethic, self-sufficiency, and self-governance originate.  It is a sanctimonious and wholly organic institution.  Men and women, though it is not some unwavering biological imperative in all cases, are genetically and biologically different - mothers typically being more nurturing, empathetic, and emotionally in-tune, and fathers typically being more stringent - stressing achievement, discipline, and hard work above all else.  Fathers are generally more geared toward what's rational and this-worldly, mothers toward what's spiritual and transcendent.  Most people who favor traditional marriage do not do so out of a deep-seated animus for those who deviate from the natural order: the Westboro Baptist Church and its devotees are but microbacteria in a petri dish.  They don't even claim the conservative mantle, in any case.  They are not our titular spokesman, nor do they represent us.   Religious and conservative leaders of yore have, for the most part, affirmed for themselves that marriage is between a man and a woman: Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II, G. K.  Chesterton, and C. S.  Lewis.  We needn't wilt or capitulate before the mob: Biblical truths and inviolable institutions are forever - much more important than elections, ambitions of power, prestige, or social acceptance."
"Money shot from the end:&gt; The virgin birth: Mary probably made up the story of God impregnating her so that she would not be an outcast or stoned to death for being a teenage, unwed mother.  She could have been raped by a Roman soldier or some other pervert as were thousands of young women.  Back then, the women were penalized more than the rapists.  She could have just told a big lie and started Christianity.  She would have had to tell Jesus that he was the son of God to keep the lie going, so he grew up really believing God was his father.  Jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of God, because he just believed what his mother told him.  This inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious, what he called the Holy Spirit.  This gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did.  He looked for the truth in the present, because he believed God, his father, would try to communicate with him.  Just thinking this opened up the door to the universal mind and the truth and the life.  Jesus was very open-minded and brave. TL;DR:  Believes the Jesus story is a myth, but that the Bible still holds truth. I'm going to pass."
"Good pens, this purchased changed my life."
Great tee shirt
We love the taste of this soda and all the flavors are great; love the smaller can size so you're not drinking a lot of soda!  We always have this on hand.
I absolutely love this.  I enjoy zoodles and have done potatoes.  Next on the list is sweet potatoes.
"Works fantastic.  I was easily able to get my charcoal going with this starter.  Easy to use, and a great price.  *Also, as a tip...* Try using a few Doritos chips as an alternative to paper to get the coals started initially.  Using paper can leave behind ashes that float around, whereas the chips catch on fire surprisingly well and leave nothing behind.  A friend showed my that little hint."
awesome shirt.
"Good selection of pens and a nice selection of colors but not all the colors pictured. I did get a ""pink"" color that is so light, I can't imagine I'd ever use it.The standard colors are good and the pens work as expected. Haven't had any skip while writing. Would be four or five stars if I received what was pictured."
My husband liked it.
Or: things not to say in prison.  My friend just got out of Federal prison and he likes this show.  He says the petty bureaucratic and stupid interpersonal fuckups are well-done.  Overblown and fictionalized but well done.  (And that she stands out too much.  By saying shit like this. )
I buy these sparkling juices because my son will not drink regular soda.  These are a tasty alternative to sodas.
This is one of my favorite all time quotes ever.   And I'm a Christian.
"Waited too long to return. I have been using these same pens for years which I buy from local retailers. Bought these particular ones online because of the great price. Problem is quantity 5 of the 24 pens I tried write too light. Supposed to be a medium point. I will continue buying these pens from local retailers not online. Think I got an old batch, however, no date code is on packaging."
Again. /While I have your attention [Here](http://www. youtube. com/watch? v=PX1sxARNq_c) is the video he made for the police.  He seems mild mannered enough in this video but if you read the article you can see he can become quite violent under the right circumstances.  If this article is true and he forced someone out of their home with a gun he is probably going to jail this time.  I will post updates as they come along.
My husband loved them!!  Perfect work shirt for him!
"I enjoy writing in color and this provides plenty of options.  It has a smooth write which I also like.  They are fun to use, either when writing or doodling.  I'd get them again."
"Let me get this straight:&gt;COPE’s challenge [PDF] states that the teaching of evolution “amounts to an excessive government entanglement with religion” and violates the rights of Christian parents. Has anyone told them the Pope accepts evolution as a scientifically valid theory?   Has anyone told them it isn't just this pope, but John Paul II as well?Are they suggesting that Catholics should ignore the Pope?   Are they suggesting that Catholics who follow the Pope are not good Christians?   Are they suggesting the current Pope and his predecessor are not good Christians?"
I love this slicer.. The smallest one is too small for most things.. But it is great and slices as expected!
"FTA:Paul is not just out to lunch when it comes to appropriating other people’s writing or hiring cranks.  Consider:- He went to Heritage Foundation to convince conservatives he was serious about foreign policy, but he defended containment of a nuclear-armed Iran.  Not even Sen.  Barbara Boxer (D-Calif. ) believes that is rational. - He went to Howard University to convince African Americans he was a different kind of Republican, but wound up lecturing them about how good Republicans had been to African Americans in the past and presenting a “you’re on you own” economic vision that has zero appeal to these voters. - He went to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to argue against help for the non-jihadi Syrian rebels, but wound up arguing Bashar al-Assad is good for Christians"
"This chimney is a small rocket stove! Fires up the coals in no time and handle stays cool. This was a great buy for me, as it holds a BIG load of coals and wood! GREAT value and this product really works."

Ink Joy are my favorite pens! Love these colors.
"The smaller cans are good for getting one to drink less soda, although are not as good value-wise. The choice of natural flavors is probably the best attraction, and not using high fructose corn syrup is also a plus. I understand that Amazon will deliver them to your door for free under certain circumstances. However, they are pricey, even with free delivery, but this could be a good factor if it gets you to drink less soda, even soda like this made with natural flavors and a more natural sweetener."
Tastes great! However it costs too much even in bulk!
Write nicely and the variety is great  .
thanks
This works great.  I am able to get my grill going in about 20 minutes now.
"These pens are great - smooth writing every time! They may be pricier than some of the other bulk ball-point pens out there, but I have never used one that didn't work. Very dependable and perfect for easy, clear writing. Will definitely purchase again when these ones run out!"
You should do a post on your past experiences on navigating without health insurance and then your experiences on the ACA process you've so far encountered.
"Great pens, pretty colors. The colors weren't as vibrant as I expected but I actually really liked than anyways. You get four blacks, three normal pen blues and three reds and three greens, with a pair of every other color. I would have preferred more color shade options but oh well."
"Yeah, people need to stop shooting elephants in the face for fun.   I think there is enough evidence to suggest they are sentient."
"It is a little big, but that is how he likes them and the length is perfect for a 6' man.  He hates a shirt that pulls up past the belt line when he lifts his arms."
"These pens have a nice feel to them while writing, and the different colors allow me to stay organized with my notes."
"I purchased my spiral slicer a few months ago, but I just started using it.  I have only used it to make zucchini noodles, but they are absolutely delicious!  I use them in a shrimp scampi dish instead of pasta; and I use them as my ""spaghetti"" for spaghetti and meatballs.  The slicer is very well-made.  I like that it has three different blades, and two of them store neatly underneath while the third stays in place on the slicer.  My husband's bookkeeper told him she pays $4.00 a bag for yellow and green squash noodles at her local store.  At that rate, this slicer will pay for itself in no time."
Love the shirt!
"Although I've bought several of the larger ""deluxe"" cutters for gifts, I'd never used one myself. After being deluged with pictures of lovely spiral cut veggies on Pintrest and Facebook, visions of all the healthy dishes danced in my mind as I got this out for my first efforts.  If you are just doing some garnish or vegetables for a single person or two entrees this may do the trick if you give yourself time but don't count on it for more than that. It's very time consuming.  You also need very firm fruit or vegetables or it mashes against the insert and the spikes in the cap instead of being cut. Too hard, I.e. carrots, can be too difficult to maintain pressure and wrist action for older people.  I gave up on the carrots but did cut apples, zucchini, cucumber and onion for this review. The cucumber had to be rearranged in its side as the center was to soft for the spikes to hold. My apple was a bit grainy and didn't work at all. The onion was surprisingly easy and fun.  Zucchini can be cut crosswise or lengthwise for faster results.  You get five nieces in the box, they are a) clear cup that holds about 10 oz. with b) optional snap-off cap on the bottom for allowing your cuttings to pass through into another larger container if needed c) shallow bladed insert for cutting thin ribbons about 1"" wide d) shallow bladed insert for cutting thin fettuccine sized ribbons and e) veggie holder with plastic spikes on it to grip your produce so you can twist said produce inside one of the inserts.  All pieces appear well made for what they are. The blades were secured tightly and the plastic is smooth and thick.Overall, I had to give this 4 stars since it is well made and does what it's supposed to but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone planning to use it a lot or prepare entrees, it just takes too long and the twisting around in the insert isn't as effective as you might hope."
"We have really been enjoying these, to the point of reordering!  The flavors are good and it is a good feeling to know that we can have a carbonated beverage that actually has some nutrition"
love these shirts
Very good quality. Heavy cotton and great sewing.  This is what a shirt should be.
"Well, his ""liberal eugenics"" argument just firmly placed him in the same category as the tea party as he makes up shit that sounds scary and appeals to the uninformed."
"They are prepping her for the next election.  A few days ago something was posted regarding her husband, Bill Clinton, saying that people should be able to keep their plan if they want to.  Now I think that this is a clear tactic used to try and separate Hillary from the Obama administration  without them saying she is against them.  Now the trick is that she is not really against him, rather, she is being the typical dem and abandoning ship to benefit herself.  Im calling it right now, there will be a rather subtle divide between her and the Obama admin.  His declining approval rating is cancerous to her campaign and she is going to start making distance."
Taste great and just the right size.
"Great flavor and love the sparkling sensation, or whatever you should call it. Great product, just wish they offered larger portions. Which really isn't even a complaint, just greed!"
"It's a Carrhart, what else need I say!"
Works great. Cooking is fun now.
"Obama was supporting known terrorist organizations and spent two weeks lying about the nature of a terrorist attack.  Even *after* it was known the Administration was lying they continued with the lie until they couldn't any more.  Why Obama hasn't been impeached over Benghazi, or a multitude of other equally serious scandals, is beyond me."
"These are so tasty, I first tried these at the hospital cafeteria and fell in love. However they still have as much sugar and calories as soda, so drink in moderation."
Genius.
"Outstanding. I didn't like nonstarcy vegies until this. We use zucchini noodles for every pasta now. Pasta salad (uncooked noodles). Otherwise I saute them in olive oil and garlic 3 minutes and add to chicken, pork, beef. WOW food is wonderful,  filling and I'm losing weight finally. We eat zucchini almost every day now. Can't wait gorgeous gardening now."
"Exactly this.  If I have to wait a year, it'll be spoiled.  I want to watch things without spoilers when they come out.  Also, my friends are all over the world.  We pirate because we want to chat about the latest episode of something like friends do."
"Republicans see the impending shut down the same as they saw the impending sequester; **as a crisis they won't have to take responsibility for that can be used for leverage. **For example, if the GOP said, ""Give us what we want or we'll defund the government and force it to shut down,"" we could easily point to their deliberate act of defunding the government as a terrorist act.  Instead, they seek out a crisis that will occur *if they do nothing at all*.  Failure to act is not the same as acting.  This way, they can say, ""its not our fault the government shut down.  We put out a balanced budget, just no one wanted it. "" Of course, no sane person will want their idea of a balanced budget but that's left for pundits and analysts to explain and the only people watching them are the same ones who already know.  The majority of people are not politically minded and don't tune in all night to political shows or read political periodicals.  As they see it, they are in the cat bird seat.  Do nothing, and you can blame the resulting crisis on Obama (why not, they blame everything on him already) OR get their way in exchange for preventing the shut down.  So, they are not saying, ""give me everything in your house or Im going to burn it down,"" they are instead saying, ""give me everything in your house or I won't douse it with my water.  Its mine and I dont have to give it to you. "" It is NOT right, and most will consider it tantamount to the same thing, but Im trying to explain that it is a very *carefully strategized* tactic to give them an out from responsibility."
He's nice because he's canadian.
Product was ok... hard to use and cumbersome... cleaning was a little difficult. I used the handheld veggetti just to alleviate the pain of using this.  If you have a Kitchenaid stand mixer... get the Spiralizer attachment!
Happy
Very good pens. use them for work
"I love this!! So far I've made beet and butternut squash ""noodles."" The suction cups do seem to slide a bit when using. Not sure if there's a way to prevent that or not. Otherwise, I love it!"
"I've recently run into these problems with my current pastor.   I was talking to him about metaphorical interpretations of certain passages in the bible that have been traditionally read literally.   When I questioned him about why he believes these passages to be literal, when all history and evidence points to it being metaphorical, he basically told me, that's just how it is, and that I don't have to analyze it too much.   He told me he's studied this before, he has references to ""prove it"", and because that's what he believes.   In other words, he told me to shut up and stop asking questions. To me, it's an insult to intelligence when someone tells me to stop thinking and just believe what's in front of me."
Switch Sparkling Juice is the best juice I ever tasted. It is now a big hit in my home we all enjoyed it. Sometimes I felt like a cold soda or a cold beer but I am afraid of too much sugar in the soda and I cannot drink beer because of my medications. Switch takes the places of the soda and the beer. I am hooked.
"Great product at a great price.  This is my husband's go-to pen for work and, as far as I'm concerned, this is the only place to buy them in sufficient quantity at a good price. Thank you."
"I wonder what metrics he's using (the article doesn't seem to mention them).  If I had to guess, the *numbers* of strong conservatives probably haven't increased, but their *activity* has, and is having an effect on the middle 40% of the country."
"I could only get to the second page.  The author needs an editor really bad.  I get it, we should be working harder to get political control over the money machine.  Tea Party Bad.  The second half of the first page ended with (possibly) calling the reader a dick. Shorten it, look hard at places where you use a lot of exclamation marks.   Your writing style is annoying."
"good quality, heavier t-shirt. Husband loves his Carhartt shirts!"
This wasnthe replacement for my first weber chimney starter. That one lasted 5+ years of heavy use and being stored outdoors in the elements. This unit seems to be built just as well.
"Works good, but I got tired of ""zoodles"" quicker than I thought. I miss my carbs. No fault of the product though."
"Also because youtube comments are a notorious clusterfuck of dumbshittery, and G thinks that one way to go about improving them is by removing their anonymity."
Never need lighter fluid again.  Works great.
"Crap.  FICA is more than SS payouts, so even if FICA goes straight into T-bills, the T-bills are then used to finance government operations.  Yes, the government is running a deficit, but SS is not part of the deficit, it is financing the deficit. The cure for deficit spending is taxation, plain and simple, not screwing the people with nothing left to lose."
"5'11"" - Athletic Build - 175lbs . Bought a Small and it fits perfectly. Made in Haiti version. Sturdy Shirt, roomy sleeves"
"This just inSwitch is the world's best drink in the world because I say so. I like it, a lot."
"For the longest time I used lighter fluid sprayed all over my charcoal to try and get a fire started, but then you are left with that lighter fluidy taste on your food. I first started seeing people using a chimney on BBQ Grillmasters. I bought one and have never looked back. It's super easy to start and the ready coals are good to go in about 10-15 mins. I have heard some people use their side burner on a gas grill to start their chimney, but I use the Weber 7417 Firestarter Lighter Cubes. They make starting a chimney a no brainer. Stop reading and buy this chimney, you won't be disappointed!"
"I guess I had a preconceieved idea of what it should taste like, though it does not taste bad; not what I expected.  All and all a good product, just not for me."
Good product.  Works well.

"I can no longer use any pens other than the InkJoy pens. These write so smoothly, and I love the colors. My only ""problem"" is that my sister steals the colors she likes and tells me that her signature color can't be used by anyone else in the family.Seriously awesome pens. Will also write on those thermal paper receipts that are difficult to work with."
best starter I ever used!
Awesome product!!! No more lighter fluid for me!!! This produces a perfect fire every time!
I ordered this for my son. I purchased one in the summer and this thing is great for starting the fire. I can put 3 pieces of paper underneath then load it up light it and in about 10 minutes it is ready to pour out in the grill. Love thi thing would recommend to anyone how wants to save on starter fluid which is now getting kinda spendy.
"Works really well. Except that the vegetable at the handle end often gets chewed up, and you have to reset the grip. All in all a good product."
"I love this spiralizer! Have been using it for about a year now, and would purchase it again. The multiple blades makes it versatile for so many things. I think it's also easy to clean and does not take up much space."
They are Carhartt's what else can you say?
Family loves this juice.  Prefers it cold however they like it either way. They have also tried the other flavors and like them also.  Comes nicely packaged.
"Nice, heavier fabric. Great for my husband's work environment."
"I'm 6'1"", and long and have a long torso. I've always had a difficult time finding t-shirts that are long enough to prevent plumbers crack. This heavy duty Carhartt fills the bill."
"Thank you for this, good sir."
"works fine, but I the suction feet don't stay put.  I thought I was buying the spiralizer that has better suction feet, but was disappointed when I discovered it's not the one I got."
Makes using charcoal super fast!

"1 is meaningless words around a false dichotomy. 2 is an attempt to repackage Pascal's Wager.  I'm certain Pascal came before CS Lewis. 3 is more meaningless words.  The kind that can mean anything depending on the reader and therefore really hold no meaning (something that can mean anything is ultimately meaningless). 4 echoes words that have been said for probably as long as we've had words to say, certainly best summed up by Shakespeare - T'is better to have loved and lost...  There is nothing ""ahead of it's time"" about that. 5 amounts to ""actions speak louder than words"".  Any form of this statement is not new or ahead of it's time. 6 is wishful thinking.  Also not a new concept which should be patently obvious in this sub given the majority here hold to a belief started some 2000ish years ago that the things in your future will be better than the past behind you.  I don't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity. 7 is a repackaging of the concept of suffering for God.  Once again, I don't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity. 8 is a statement that would hold true no matter when it was said.  In that way it was of it's time when he first said it, not ahead of it's time. 9 is probably the only example of a thought from CS Lewis (in this list) that is ahead of it's time.  Though I genuinely doubt it is a thought that wasn't expressed or taught or followed by some congregations somewhere in the world throughout the history of the church. 10 basically says ""heaven is good"".  That's not a thought ahead of it's time.  Once again, CS Lewis does not pre-date Christianity. Less of a list of quotes that show he was ahead of his time.  More of a lot of repetition of previous philosophers/theologians, a collection of meaningless phrases, and a single progressive thought."
"When right wingers whine that the USA has some of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, I remind them that these ""rates"" are like the manufactures suggested retail prices for mattresses...... nobody actually pays it, everyone gets a special ""sale"" price."
"Very cool, writes great and I have lots of them now.  You know how pens always seem to walk.  I got these because I've lent pens out at work, I can never find a pen at home.  Now I have a nice big pack which I will keep in my drawer and shhh nobody knows.  Here's what I liked besides the way it writes.  I like that when I took the 1st one out and figured I would just start using it, I click it and start writing.  Nope, you have to take a little wax ball off the end which is there to keep the ink fresh.  Love that.  I don't think I've ever purchased a pen that had that on there.  Great idea!"
"I have had several hand-held gadgets that claim to spiralize veggies, but none of them were of very good quality. I finally decided to get one of these, and I'm glad I did. I have made cucumber noodle for cold Thai salads, zucchini noodles to use in place of pasta, sweet potato curls for fries, apple spirals for desserts, and much more. I am actually surprised at how much this thing gets used. I would definitely recommend this product."
"It was shared because of the mentality women are subjected to, by pastors, by fellow church members, by family and coworkers... a mentality that lacks compassion and heaps blame and guilt on a victim of violence.  This story is am extreme example, yet it gets to the crux of the epidemic... yes an epidemic that is causing trauma, mInjury and even death to millions of women all over the world.  Even us ""civilized"" nations are not immune, with violence against women at only slightly lower rates than developed nations... according to WHO. The church can do better, from the most conservative to the most liberal to work to end this"
"This is another of Weber's products that works as advertised. Great,easy, no mess way to start charcoal."
"All Carhartt clothes fit some what lager, so I went and tryed them on at local retailer(they did not have the size and color I wanted) and ordered here."
Good fit for my husband.
Great product and Seller to work with.
"I love these pens. Smooth ink, no bleeding, no bubbles."
Can't dispute any of it.
Pens
"This fruit punch is more punch than fruit.  I may not be the most objective reviewer, however, of Switch beverages as the only one I really think hits the spot on taste and carbonation is grape.  I won't be ordering fruit punch again, only grape."
It's Carhartt and I surely hope they last as long as the other Carhartt products.
This is a great product to light coals with just using newspaper. No lighter fluid needed!
"I think there's some truth to this.  You really have to be divorced from the reality of how religious thought works not to realize that religious conservatism is an incubator for irrationalism and therefore for all sorts of stupidity and ignorance.  It is not a coincidence that people who come from a place of heavy-handed orthodoxy, superstition, and tribalism in religion tend to espouse a particularly irrational, brutal politics."
"I'm kind of confused by his post.   ""And while my healthcare. gov application has been stuck for a month now at the “View Eligibility Results” stage""In other words, he has no insurance.   He says he can pick up the phone, etc, but he hasn't done so yet.   He's assuming he can still apply and that there will be no problems there as well.   Perhaps he should finish enrolling first before he says how great it is to be covered?"
Very good product.
"Absolutely love these pens! There are a ton of pens in this pack, you will never run out (unless you lose them). They are long lasting. The colors are awesome and all can be easily read. These do not bleed and are not very inky. Great for the doodler :)"

I Love Paper Mate InkJoy pens and this is the best price I've ever found anywhere.
"Last I checked my Bible, a Jewish mob led by the Jewish priests of the time dragged Jesus to the Roman Prefect, Pontius Pilate, and basically told him to either execute the man as a traitor or they'd riot and destroy his career.  Pilate tried to reason with the mob and find a way out, but ultimately decided a miscarriage of justice was preferable to having the city torn apart with Jesus probably just being lynched anyways. So, it looks like Jesus was killed by a mob of 1st century Jews.  How is that controversial?"
Great fit!
Great quality and fits perfectly.
"Will be ordering the future !,,,,It was very good my son has ask me to get him some its very light taste too"
"Zoodles! This machine is so fun! I'm pretty sure I spiralized everything in my pantry when I got it. Machine is old fashioned- i.e.. plastic and not one of those tech/battery operated appliances so it's nice to have that breath of fresh air when cooking (reminds me of spending time with my grandma in the kitchen), but it's SUPER easy to use and just as easy to take apart and clean. Highly recommend!"
"These shirts are the best.  I've purchased them for myself & guys that work for me and we all agree these are ""work"" shirts.  Yes, they run a little large, and if you ordinarily wear an XL you can probably get by with an L no problem, but I like the extra room.  They tuck in well (like if you wear a tool belt), and they hang out just as comfortably."
These flew out of the fridge
"I have been reading a lot of articles about Blackstone.   Just because they have deep pockets, doesn't mean they know what they are doing. The idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous.   They can't maintain those properties properly.   Each house has its own set of unique issues, because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves.   The people who cooked up this plan, should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes.   Oversight would be easier, the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently.   For all we know the reason they didn't go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual properties. Remember the part in Upton Sinclair's book ""The Jungle"" where the family rents to own a property, that is in fact just badly built with a ""cess pool"" underneath.   This is what is happening again. All they are creating are slums in neighborhoods, destroying the true market value of properties, and denying regular folk the opportunity to own a home."
"The Switch is a great product and a great value for the price. I keep a supply on hand at all times by regularly ordering two cases at a time from Amazon. The drink is delicious and wholesome, consisting, as they say, of just bubbles and juice. The flavors are rich without being too sweet as there is no added sugar or syrup. I love The Switch and highly recommend it."
"Perfect, excellent product"
Love the product!  It's fun to use and easy to clean.
This is a great product and the price is amazing.  I was able to purchase this at such a discount it made it even better. Thank you
Nice
Straightforward!   Thank you for sharing
"although we use the grill very often, I have yet to use it..."
Works like a champ! It does exactly what it is supposed to do.
Yeah I didn't get far.  This article fills me with sadness

"lol i read this a the ""Colbert Report"" and was like damn, legit Stephen."
Augusta National received pressure for years because they wanted a men only club.   There wasn't any restriction on who could play just who could be members and women couldn't leave it alone.
Heheheheheheheh
My kids are not allowed to have soda at schools so I give them these as a GREAT alternative. They LOVE THIS STUFF! My daughter was a fan of the Izze drinks and both my son and daughter said these taste way better than Izze and they come in way more flavors. 100% juice and a great healthy choice. I will be on reorder!
"This is really good juice, it doesn't stay around very long when we buy it. Everyone loves it"
I have never used one of these before so honestly I'm having a little trouble however clean up was fast and not a hassel hopefully as I get to use it more I'll become more efficient
Tastes great...kids love it.
This is going to piss off reddit.  /r/AdviceAnimals is already drawing up a protest meme as we speak.
A sad day in conservative circles; he made our job so easy.  You don't have to prepare a cogent argument when this moron is presenting the other side.
"This item is great, effective and a breeze to use."
"Great air flow, quickly ignites the charcoal.  Works much better than the style I used before."
I really think these are the best quality shirt in this style I've owned.
EXTREMELY disappointed with my purchase. Then pens picture are NOT what I received and I  very upset as there are colours pictures I was excited about but they are not included in the pack I received. This is FALSE ADVERTISING!!!
"I love this toy! I've used it to make zoodles, carrots spirals and apple spirals. It's not a perfect product (there is nothing to catch the vegetables as they twirl out and if a vegetables is on the thin side it puts out ""c"" shapes instead of curls. Still, easy to clean, easy to use and makes vegeables and fruits really fun to eat."
Fits great for my husband and lasts until he gets too many stains to wear for good but them wears a long time as work shirt.
"Not to Republicans or conservatives.   You're only part of American exceptional ism if you buy into the false idea of the rugged individual and ""traditional American conservatism. """
"On a side note:  Today I learnt  Psalm 137 mentioned in this article inspired ""By the Rivers of Babylon"" by Boney M - which was one of my favorite records many years ago."
"Colors are great but they leave a gunky ink blot which ruins the item you are writing. I love the colors and love writing but that is the only flaw for me. If that doesn't bother you then you will love the colors, smooth writing and fun of these pens. Just not for me. It would be fine for a younger person for drawing or whatever. The price is good for an inexpensive pen."
"really delicious I just may have to get another case or two down the road a little later, real natural."
The other day we had 30 mph gusty winds coming through as a cold front came through. I just knew I wasn't going to be able to get the charcoal lit easily but much to my surprise this made it a breeze.  I used the weber fire cubes and have already ordered more.  I like the dual handles.
Works well.
"Ah.  I have adblock, but am presently getting 'trending' items for the top few bits of my newsfeed.  One of your obscure friends mentioned mustard?  Mustard is trending, here is that friend's post, followed by a post by French's that you didn't want to see! Example in my newsfeed right now?  Buffalo, New York is trending.  Timothy Xxxx and 30 others (who I am not friends with / fans of - a few newspapers, and other random pages) posted about it.  Followed by Tim's excited Buffalo Bills post, and a post from Bernadette Peters (who? ) telling me that she's performing with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra tomorrow night. It's terribly irritating."
"I really like inkjoy! enjoyable to write with because the ink just flows out. However, these don't last very long. Also, it is prone to pooling and bleeding. I'm still going to keep using them though, they write well."
This is a tad bigger than the other one we had and seems to heat up even faster. There is only two of us so we don't fill it very full.
Im always shocked that people care about this (of all things) during every Christmas season.  What a checkout person says to me has absolutely zero to do with how jolly my Christmas is and it makes me wonder about those for whom its an issueedit: grammar
"Works like a charm! Say goodbye to lighter fluid. I just use the paper part of a charcoal bag, tear some off, and light it. That means a bag of charcoal is literally all I need to get this thing fired-up. As I empty charcoal from the bag, I just tear another strip off around the bag, and use it to light the chimney."
Only purchased one time but it was great while it lasted. My kids loved these too.
That's *moms*demandaction. org...
Same here.  The verdict is as sad as it is predictable.
They want the government shut down and they want the Republicans to bear the responsibility.The MSM will do their best to make sure that happens.
"We finally broke down and purchased this to try out the zoodles we had heard so much about. The product is very easy to use and easily cuts through every vegetable we have tried! I would be happy if we could attach a bowl to it instead of letting the sliced food fall onto the counter or a baking sheet. It also isn't very easy to clean. You have to put the entire thing in the sink to rinse it and then remove all the extra unused attached blades to dry. It isn't difficult at all, just a few extra steps I could live without. We would definitely purchase again and are enjoying finding new uses for our spiralizer."
Perfect.  Well designed and was to use.  Blades store safely and are easy to change out.
"If you've always wanted your apple juice to have bubbles, then this is for you.  Kids seem to really like it.  Tastes like diet soda to me.  It was ok."
I love it
Done.
"You can be angry at the people who promote something.  I'm not angry with theism, that's too nebulous.  But I am angry at the Westburough Baptist Church.  But there is a difference between being angry and being effective.  Anger can motivate you to get something done."
Wow!  Cabbage slaw is fabulous with this. Flavor is so fresh and texture is very fine. Will never buy pre-shredded bagged slaw again!
Haha perfect.
I've been trying to stay away from sodas & energy drinks for my family & I.  This has been a perfect & tasty alternative!!!
I got this for myself around Christmas time. I made a couple of dishes - zucchini spaghetti and a spiralized cucumber salad. I plan to make a carrot salad using the fine (angel hair) blade. I'm looking forward to that - but have not talked myself into getting the big carrots and cutting them to size to do it. I like having it as an option - but not sure I should have bought it. It does work.
"I bought these because I am pregnant and I wanted something carbonated to drink when I was feeling sick besides soda. These taste wonderful. Some flavors are better than others, I like the tangerine flavor the best, the watermelon flavor isn't the best in my opinion."

"Nah, am worse in real-ity."
These are really neat to do art with.  My grand kids and I love these.
Item was as described and shipping was prompt.  Will definitely order this again at a later date.  Would use this seller again!
"First off--It's easy to use and easy to clean. I have used this to make so many different spiraled veggie noodles, like cucumber, sweet potato, zucchini, ekc., and present them with outstanding sauces. I am gluten free now, and the number one item (besides bread) I thought I'd die without was pasta. I was such a pasta freak! But I have found with the spiralizer I can make all kinds of noodle dishes that I am really pleased with. I have brought several variations on spiralized dishes to dinner parties and potlucks and without fail I have been asked for the recipes and where to buy the spiralizer. I should become a spokesperson for the company. I have also had many friends call me and tell me how much their children loved the veggie noodles and always want more. There are a lot of kitchen gadgets I would give up if I had to, but this one is a keeper."
We discovered this drink at a school picnic.  100% juice with carbonation fooled the 1st graders into thinking they were drinking pop.  I bought a case to take camping with us and the kids (and parents) loved it.  I like the 8 oz. portion and the ingredients.  This will be on my auto-ship for sure!
great
this product worked out very good
Great shirt
So awesome! I'm spiralling everything!
"This is definitely a problem with blogging style journalism.  They likely don't go through editors before hitting the screen, because on nearly EVERY article these days ""these are the views of *such and such*, and not our company"" to protect them...  because they don't check their work."
Work okay
"Great gift idea, well made too."
Very good quality; well-made.  Previous purchases of this item seem to indicate that these shirts will last a long time.
"The policy on Cuba is probably the most antiquated we have.  The Cold War is over yet we continue those policies on that country and that country only.  How many Americans have they kidnapped or killed in the last 30 years?  Yet we continue to do business with Saudi Arabia, a country which produced most of the hijackers for 9/11.  What if those 19 Saudi hijackers were Cuban extremists?  Sanctions would be tightened regardless and maybe even another invasion would have been considered.  It's so ridiculously antiquated it would be hard to take seriously if it weren't for the real human cost our embargo causes."

Great purchase. Very smooth and a great price
"There are already a number of alternatives called ""Alt-coins"".   There are usually based off of bitcoin itself with different tweaks.   If those tweaks make them better then bitcoin, they could become worth more.  However, currently bitcoin has a huge lead in terms of the network effect, meaning lots of people are involved in mining, owning and using bitcoin.   They already have software and infrastructure in place to work with bitcoins, so it would take some effort for them to move to a different crypto currency. It could happen, but there would need to be a very good reason."
"This is great to start the fire, and for to do new fire if you need more meanwhile you are in the BBQ..."
Loved it! It came in on time and it was well packaged. I can't wait to use it
"The quality of the material used for the shirt was unbeatable for the price. Though, the S,M,L, etc. sizes were not indicative of the actual shirt size. I am just over 6 foot tall and the medium shirt fit like a dress on me."
No he just has a brain.
I used to watch WLTX.  :)
"Love my Paper Mate InkJoy retractable pens.  Variety of colors are bright and stand out.  Pens come with a small ball of wax on end of pen, so remove that before using.  Ink flows freely.  I've used Paper Mate pens in my profession and never had to look for another pen because the ball point wouldn't work."
"This drink has a TON of sugar, carbs and 120 calories per can. NOT a good replacement for anything. Total rip off. And you CAN'T RETURN IT.Just get sparkling water and add one or two tablespoons of your choice of juice and you'll be a LOT better off! I mix Pellegrino water a splash of Stevia or xylitol sweetened lemonade and it's delightful."
Start the charcoal really fast and evenly. I use it with starter pills and no fluid. It glows red and is hot

"I needed some extra black and blue pens and knew my daughter would love to have some colorful pens, so we went with this pack. Great assortment; great value! The pens write well, and are long lasting."
"As a current Mainer, I want to point out that Angus is usually the most calm, composed, well-spoken person.  When I read what he apparently said, I was shocked.  I had to read it again because I didn't believe that it was him who said it.  I've never seen him say anything that passionate.  It was touching.  :-)"
Great machine. My daughter and I love it. Lots if fun as well. Easy to prepare healthy meals.
Tried this on rutabaga and it wouldn't work. I wouldn't recommend this product.
"not to be a buzzkill, but you can bet the vast majority of those veterans voted republican, and will continue to do so.  you can't make the weather then complain when it rains.  the GOP agenda parted ways with their so-called ideology a long time ago.  anyone, and i mean anyone, making less than $750,000 a year that votes republican today is a bona fide idiot.  they need to stop voting a party line and start voting for the party that really represents their interests."
"The GOP is getting snot hammered in the local media and by the business community down here.   No surprise FL repugs are jumping ship.   If they don't get something done on immigration before 2014 it's going to be bloody, gerrymandering or not."
This asshole is going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of Americans.
Yet another great rant about how Christians suck at being Christians.
One of the smoothest pens I have ever written with!
This shirt really fits well and very comfortable to wear.really worth it.
"Great product, works well!"
Highly recommend.
"The problem comes when the ""personality"" some ascribe to Jesus is utterly, completely counter to everything he taught us.  When people who want to worship a schoolyard bully Jesus rant about ""pansies"" they are not simply behaving counter to Jesus' teachings themselves, they are pretending that Jesus was the exact opposite of what he taught. I've had people in this subreddit argue that protesting a wedding like a bargain basement Fred Phelps is acting Christlike.  You can't separate the unloving actions from the hateful personality some want to ascribe to our Lord."
"The religious party should read their bible (James 1:19), ""Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry""."

Great Pens  love to write with them . Such great colors

As a conservative: Morality and economics don't and shouldn't mix...
Received quickly and exactly as expected.
Sounds like the Democrats too.
Making 'class warfare' seem like a bad thing was one of the smartest things rich people ever did.
"Edit: I'll preface with this:The title and article linked above is a misconception of most progressives because:(Most) republicans are believers in the Free Market.  I may get nuked for this, but the Tea Partiers/conservatives/republicans don't have a plan because *no plan is necessary*.  Because if you remove the laws holding back entrepreneurs from starting a business, they will 'fill the hole' with a service/product at competitive prices, because others will be offering same/similar product/services.  This competition is what drive prices down.  *Customers voting with their money. *It's a perfect example of the argument of Centralized planning&amp;control vs.  free market. One of the arguments for years is that if insurance companies could (in the past) have offered plans nation-wide, rather then limited by state borders, the dollar cost averaging of health care would have been more effective. anyway, my 2 cents."
Easy to use to start charcoal.
Very easy to use
"this guy has to go.  not only does he look like a turtle, he folds like a cheap suit. same with boehner, hatch, cornyn, mccain, graham ..."
I have tried 3 flavors and didn't particularly like this flavor...neither do my kids.  It is small and expensive and doesn't satisfy a thirst that much when served with a lunch but I guess it's an okay alternative to soda pop.  Drink very cold! :)
"Okay, how about this?  Go talk to your conservative neighbors if you live in GOP district ( I am registered to vote in GOP district in Cali, but I live in a Dem house district in Cali)  and ask them why they support this GOP obstructionism?  Ask them whether it does the country any good?"
the best- all juice w/ a little carbonation

"The Cooch had a huge lead at first, and I was freaking terrified that we'd be stuck with Ken *American Taliban* Cuccinelli for four years, leading to all sorts of anti-abortion, anti-health-care, and anti-LGBT-rights nonsense.  Thank goodness the DC suburbs saved us!!!"
I have a cousin working in Japan and she recently explained what she went through to register in their single-payer system.  It is very simple and very efficient.
"Why in the ever loving fuck is this formatted the way it is.  Just link the clip, man."
"Way too large, gave it to one of my big friends because I did not want amazon to ban me for too many returns."
Requires a good amount of pressure and that makes it slide. Creates a mess also.It works fast though.
"I work at a hotel and bought these for myself to use because I hate the regular pens the company provides.  I need/want a wider grip and a 'thicker' pen than those skinny ones.  It literally hurts my hands to use the skinny ones.The only gripe I have is that it smudges a bit after writing, but that's mostly the coating on our keycard holders which is kind of glossy.I still love these pens and deducted a star for the smudginess but admit it may be a issue of the paper type I'm writing on."
"I've ordered it three times and enjoy it more each time I break open a can. It's unusually refreshing and really different served very, very cold. If you like your fruit punch frutier, well there's always that pure sugar stuff they sell at the super market. This drink is balanced just right. I love it and I don't even own stock in the company."
"Medical personal are named in the lawsuits.  So yes, they are in legal trouble.  Hopefully it sticks."
"Sadly, they already have.  The public schools and colleges are simply indoctrination centers for the liberal agenda controlled by socialist teachers unions. When I was in first grade, my parents bought me nice, Crayola-brand markers for class.  The first day of school, the teacher took them from me and gave me back cheap RoseArt/Store Brand markers, with one or two of my original Crayola markers.  That was the first lesson in socialism.  Some students had better supplies than others, and that was unfair.  This practice is done in most public schools, ask any parent."
NICE!
Bought for my brother. He loved the shirts. They are very nice quality made shirts. The size is right spot on. Color stays on these shirts. The fade mode is unbelievably great. Wished they had more colors.
"As good as they say! My tactic for buying on Amazon is to ignore all the five star reviews and go to the 1-2 star. That way I'm not fooled by the fake reviews and I can ensure that the bad reviews aren't so bad. All the other spiralizers had really telling bad reviews but this one was minor and there were lots of Amazon verified purchases in the good reviews. So I decided to give it a try and this machine really works well! So far I've sliced apples, potatoes, yams, and cucumbers without a problem. I made homemade baked potato chips for my family and my kids just loved them! Tonight I made a sweet potato for myself and the slices were perfect and in 20 minutes I had a delicious healthy meal. So glad I found this!"
Love it!! Starts fire easily everyone!!!9
"Love this item! Works great, super easy to use!"
"People who don't understand this are idiots.  You can't claim your product can diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease unless it has been proven in clinical trials and approved for said use by the FDA.  If you go through said process then your product is legally a drug and you can claim it does the things it is approved to treat.  If you aren't willing to go through this process then you are making bullshit claims and you need to hire a marketing team that doesn't have it's head up its own rear."
I found this to be a cheaply made pen which doesn't write very smoothly.
OMG I never thought a chimney starter could be an all star among my BBQ tools. This unit lights up charcoal quickly with minimal paper.Worth the extra $5 over the smaller one.
"I personally, as a non-soda drinker, like the taste of this. My husband wasn't impressed. But for me it just isn't worth 120 calories. I would rather have a naturally flavored, calorie free sparkling water and there are many varieties of those out there now, so no need to waste calories on this, IMO."
"Works well. A few cautions. If you are using lump charcoal, make sure you keep it down in the grill and not on top. It can shoot some abers sometimes. Also can make dumping the lit charcoal a bit of a risky item. I will probably be getting the kind that you can release the bottom out of the starter. Thus not risking anything happening when having to turn the starter over to dump the charcoal. This one is nice and big and never had a problem with heat transfer to the handle, fires up nice I will just be going with the safer option in my opinion that does not make you turn it over to dump the lit charcoal. Also be careful when using lump charcoal in that sometimes a piece can get stuck in the bottom and missed after the dump if you don't check carefully."
"Put a sheet and a half of newspaper under this, ignite it, and the charcoal you've already loaded into it will be ready to cook with in about half the time it would without the starter. I wear gloves when dumping it. I especially like the bail (the swinging handle) for emptying the starter. I've seen slightly cheaper Weber charcoal starters that have only the rigid handle. I'm glad I spent the few extra dollars for this model."
"Not impressed, have to renew tip each time I use it or it won't write."
My only gripe with this shirt is it's too freaking long. I'm 6 feet tall and this shirt hangs down past or to my front pant pockets! Perhaps it will shrink a bit?
"I don't think many people would argue that we shouldn't read the Qu'ran.   At most, these articles say:  if you want to understand Islam, don't *only* read the Qu'ran.   There are a lot of hadiths, and scholarly rulers, history and tradition in Islam as well."
Works well!
"I was pretty excited about this kitchen gadget, but was a little disappointed when I used it. I may not be using it right, but it cuts everything fine, but when I start spiralizing and my zucchini gets smaller and smaller, there is a part of the spiralizer that pushes out the bowl away from where it needs to be. Because of this, my zoodles are all over the countertop instead of the bowl where I would prefer them. I really like the concept of it but, the unit itself does feel a little cheap, so I am concerned it won't hold up as long as I would like it to."
You have to have one of these!  Makes charcoal barbecuing quick and easy.  Coals light in 15 minutes.  Down use lighter fluid!  This lights faster and much safer.
God I hope so.
This favors aetheists so its religious discrimination either way
"Big Pharma is a huge opponent of medical marijuana, but their influence is nothing compared to the ""herp derp drugs are bad"" aging Puritans that form a large percentage of this country.  We will progress as a nation one funeral at a time."
Shrank different then all my carhart shirts that I've bought in store. Shrank upwards which didn't work with my longer torso.
Delicious!!  Worth buying.
"Just finished listening, it was pretty interesting.  I love Keller, although I have to say he didn't push hard enough on what sounded a bit like a kind of slippery sophistry coming from Epstein: Appealing to beauty in trying to define what beauty is, assuming there's a place ""where we're going,"" etc.  it seemed like he did this the whole time."
Love these shirts!
I bought these for a teachers gift they were a wonderful mix of colors at a great price.
Good pens at a reasonable price. I'm constantly having mine lost/stolen/broken and these have held up alright.
"I don't think it was mocking Obamacare, it was mocking everyone else.Have you ever noticed that when SNL did skits with George Bush, Bush was the joke, but when they do skits with Obama, everyone else is the joke and Obama is level-headed?"
I really appreciate this device. It eliminates my need to use lighter fluid which I did not like in the first place.
"Natural , Healthy, Delicious, Great Variety, & Reasonable Price.FANTASTIC DRINK!  TRY IT!yeah baby yeah baby yeah baby yeah"
Reliable and inexpensive.  Would recommend for anything besides heavy use.  There are more comfortable pens for extended writing.
"Handcuffed, he was thrown so hard into the back of the vehicle his feet lifted off the ground.  Go ask martial artist friends if a person can get beat on using only throws.  Or, heck, look it up on the internet.  It is worse if you are receiving the throw untrained and cuffed."
I love it. It's plain and simple and just what I wanted.
My dad usually wears a 2x and that's what I ordered. He tried it on and it was way to big!
"Out of all the flavors I tried, I would have to say the kiwi-strawberry and the watermelon were my favorites."
Gets love it. These are the only T-shirts my dad wears as well
Are you surprised?It's Mother Jones.
We haven't had a chance to try it yet.  It seems like a great idea.  That is the chore we hate the most about making the fire to cook with -- lighting the briquettes and tasting yucky lighter fluid.
"My favorite chimney starter so far. I like the size and have used it for years. Also, I store it outside and the AZ weather hasn't affected the handle at all."
Love that guy
"T-shirts came from 4 different manufacturers but they all fit as expected. For new Carhartt t-shirt buyers, the shirts can feel rough until you wash them a few times. I've worn these t-shirts for years. On average, I will get about 1 year of steady use out of these shirts before they start to show wear. I usually have 7-10 shirts I wear on a daily basis. Can't say enough about Carhartt clothing."
Bought this as a gift.  These chimneys are always good to have around.
"As a non-american this is getting annoying.  If half the population of your country is this stupid then why haven't the other half tricked them into just going along with them?  The only thing left to think about americans is that the whole bloody lot are dumb as shit. I know you aren't really all stupid, I have many good intellgent friends who are americans, but you guys do need to realize how the entire world is looking at you like a bunch of monkeys with dynamite and matches right now."
"First sampled in a variety pack, and so far this is the only flavor I liked enough to go back and buy a full carton of.  I love the flavor and the effervescence.  Even the scent is appetizing.  Though it's not sugar-free, it is real juice, and a nice change from cola."
My husband just wore it for the first time yesterday. It looks great. It's roomy and he likes that.
"I like grilling my meat so much that we regularly have grilling sessions at home. Growing up, I always helped my dad at the grill so I know my way around the pit. When I moved to my new home with my wife and son, I made sure to buy the best griller I can get my hands on and everything that accompanies the grill. That is why I bought this chimney starter.I prefer a chimney starter as compared to using flammables like a lighter fluid. This chimney starter is made with sturdy aluminium steel. It even has a handle that stays cool even if the briquettes are heating up. But still I would not recommend holding it with bare hands. This chimney starter is very effective in evenly lighting all the briquettes for my grill use. This is especially useful if I needed extra lighted charcoals for when I slow cook something over the grill. Really great!"
"Walker turned in the aide that had embezzled which actually prompted the investigation into that issue, and was not charged with anything related to the aide that sent campaign-related emails while on the job, after extensive investigations into both issues.   The author's failure to look into these issues and subsequent noise about ""ethical clouds"" is shoddy.   The only reason there are ""ethical clouds"" is because of journalists who re-state these unwarranted allegations to the casual news reader.   If Walker violated some campaign law, rest assured that it will come to light (because he has polarized his constituency and will be subjected to investigations for any allegations of scandal... this being the third such investigation that I am aware of in his few years in office), but let's not implicate him in two prior scandals that he was investigated for and cleared of in order to paint him with the guilty brush before this investigation is concluded."
Yes I would.
The GOP is a steadily shrinking party so they are desperately putting up walls to cling to power as long as possible.
"Great quality, durable, decent capacity.  Happy with this purchase"

Sources say no.  But I hope it is!
"If someone can provide an article by the Post of some liberal professor calling for George Bush to get a third term, then I'll take them seriously.   But this is a nation of 300,000,000 people, and I refuse to believe that any one man is suited for presidency more than two terms. I'd be more than thrilled for one year terms, with no reelection.   The power is too great to hold for any extended length of time."
"What is he doing with jars of honey around?  To my knowledge, honey isn't exactly gourmet food, like champagne or whiskey - can't he just buy some at his intended destination? Yes yes, I know, erosion of liberty, etc.  etc.  Still, is there anything special about the honey?"
"Can this be true? &gt; We don't have to wonder whether a health care system built on capitalist profit-seeking is more efficient and less expensive than those in which the government exercises more control.  There has been a test running for decades, with many developed countries doing it one way, and the United States doing it the other.  The results couldn't be clearer. ---&gt; On almost any criterion you can come up with, the government-controlled systems work better."
My kids love this juice!!!
Nice pens I use them to draw with and they work very well.
nice extra thing for your weber grill
"But what *can* be done?  ""Too big to fail"" is a very real thing, especially now, with so many people retiring and set to retire over the next 10 years or so, and so much of their retirement invested in the stock market.  You take down the major banks and force a massive market correction, and you essentially wipe out the life savings of millions of people.  There's a reason the fed is pumping so much money into the stock market, trying to spin up share prices in any way possible: because we don't really have any choice."
"Serious question: What does that make us?   Because it kind of feels like being hostages.   Not specifically to extremist political factions, but to a broken and corrupt system that allows extremism to dictate the future.   After all the shouting back and forth between Team Red and Team Blue, we're all going to look up and realize that there are guards at the door, bars on the window, and cameras on the walls."
"I had watermelon pop made by the Coca-Cola company for China while at Epcot center's Coke pavilion in the past and wondered why they never marketed it in the USA because it's excellent.  So when I saw watermelon berry as a flavor with Switch and that it was pure juice besides, I had to try it and all their flavors.  Overall, the watermelon doesn't disappoint and does remind me of that soda, but probably better having real juice in it.  But all the flavors, in addition to the described flavors have added juices to them that have nothing to do with the flavor (i.e. apple and acerola).  For flavors like lemon and lime this makes sense because if they didn't have other juices added they would be very sour with no added sugar, but it is disappointing for flavors like grape where those additions clearly subtract from the ""grape juice"" flavor, which I'd prefer to be stronger.  Even so, it still tastes better than grape soda and grape is the strongest flavor.  None of the flavors here are 'bad' at all.  All taste better than flavored soda, IMO and have to be much better for you with plenty of vitamin C and no added sugar (fructose is better for you than sucrose).  Certainly, having carbonation in juice (particularly the orange flavor) is definitely different.  It's worth trying if not replacing fruit flavored soda entirely."
"Why only spending cuts?  Include subsidy slashes and across the board tax increases, especially for corporations.  Then see how quickly Republicans come running to the table."
"Sorry but this article is.... meh.  It's the same arguments against sola scriptura that have been rehashed over and over again. We wouldn't know what the NT canon is without the church!  [response](http://triablogue. blogspot. com/2009/06/new-testament-canon. html? m=1) The author also uses the standard ""The Bible says hold to the traditions! "" There's no compelling evidence that the Apostles taught or believed in the Assumption of Mary other than Sola Ecclesia (the church says so).  This is really sola scriptura vs sola ecclesia."
"This chimney starter is so much better than the cheap, box store ones we've bought in the past.  The extra metal piece on the handle makes it much easier to pour than other starters we've had.  Like many other reviewers, we use a piece of newspaper to get the charcoal started.  Heats within 15-20 minutes."
I know people got on the corn syrup is bad train and never looked at the research when it was completed.. But sugar is sugar and this is some teeth rotting condensed apple juice.... With carbonation to bring up the ph.  Kid says its awesome and he buys it at school (blargh!!). But its too high in sugar for anything other than a special occasion.
"This is a perfectly sized chimney starter for smaller grills I had never used one of these and was amazed at how fast I could go from lighting a little parrafin cube under the briquettes to cooking about 15 minutes later. I have the larger version as well, but that's more charcoal than I usually require, and this one is much more manageable. Great, but simple product."
These are great shirts and I bought these several times and plan to get more.
"Imagine this: juice molasses diluted with equal parts water and carbonation. The result? Something that can convince soda drinkers to switch over to something which is just as terrible for you.I was looking forward to this sampler all week and it was just a disappointment. Half the flavors are way too sweet to drink and the other ones are barely palettable. I think this product has an excellent message; however, it seems to be dressing up New-age soda into something it is not: healthy."
I love this for making Zucchini spaghetti.
To long.
My kids love Switch.  I'd give this to them over soda any day.
This would make me so happy.  It sounds like they might move him to a later spot though.  Honestly if they were smart they'd just drop him.
Still learning to get foods cut properly for spiralizing but love the end results. Happy I purchased the Paderno.
"I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Seemed like a cheap slicer, but it is really simple and cool how it works.  I wish there were a few other cutting options, but really can't complain; for the price, a great addition to any kitchen"
If you are looking for a pack of cheap pens these work. Some of them even work sort of nicely - but only sort of... for the most part they are just cheap pens. Don't buy into the ads for these pens being wonderful to write with.
Awesome product
"Works awesome.  Takes no time to get EVERY brick cooking just right, unlike trying the old school method of lighting them in a pile on the ground.  I would recommend this."
Product is fine.  Just not for guys like me with small horrible writing.  I need a finer tip.
"If you grill with charcoal and you don't have one of these, you are wasting your time. It is so easy to use and makes grilling foolproof."
"I read reviews to try and help make my decision about something, but I'm glad I listened to those who spoke about the positives of this drink.The flavors are all excellent and the orange can actually be compared to Fanta as far as taste goes. They are just juice with carbonation because some people, like me, enjoy the bubbles of soda but not the empty calories. At least when I drink this I can get some vitamin C out of it. The cans are too cute and I dont feel guilty if I drink 2 of these. The sugars are fine because they come from the fruit. I just love this drink and will continue to buy them. Very delicious and satisfying. I wonder what else the Switch brand will come up with."
"Schooling needs to give kids a taste of things and find out what they like, are good at, and enjoy.  Everything in your post could be applied to any subject in school, be it maths, sciences, history, social studies, etc.  I think it's pretty flabby that we have art, and phys ed, but not something like basic programming.  Programming is one of the backbones in modern society, and becoming more so every year. We really shouldn't continue on this path of producing children who know little about computers besides operating their iDevices, browsing the web, and some gaming.  I've read a lot of assessments suggesting that kids today are less literate than kids who were born in the 80's. It's all well and good that we've turned computing into a basic commodity like we did with cars.  Unlike cars though, there are dozens of millions of jobs that require high level computing knowledge, programming skills, problem solving, etc.  Not knowing how your car works or how to fix it isn't closing huge amounts of doors to you or possibly limiting your career potential in many industries."
Love my Zoodles!
Working like new
"I'm curious whether McAuliffe's victory changes reddit's stance on money in politics, considering he is a guy who has never been elected to public office and is riding a wave of out of state money?"

"This from the people who scream that Obama has taken their ""freedoms"" away"
What did they even mean by death panels?  Nobody explained that to me.
They're okay. I like the Pilot G2 gel pen much better.
No complaints at all .. Solid fire starter . Highly recommended
HUGE and built like a tank! I hope you have plenty of room to store this bad boy. Great at doing what is was made for and hasn't rusted yet!
"We noticed these drinks in the refrigerated case at Whole Foods and decided to try the grape and cherry which ended up being our family favorites.  The size is perfect for us, as even a 12-ounce can is too large. I had not enjoyed soda much in recent years due to no nutritional value, but since this soda is basically carbonated fruit juice, I can enjoy the tingle of soda with the wholesomeness of the ingredients; the best of both worlds.  After finding out that Whole Foods no longer stocks this product, we were delighted to find it on amazon.com."
Nice
"Great shirt, not too thing, sturdy construction.  Love the availability of a variety of colors."
So easy to use and so fast.
"Oh man - this thing is like magic! Even better then I expected.3 pages at the bottom, load coals on top of it - light it and wait.That's it.Had family over - he is used to lighter fluid , waving , sweating - he was completely blown away by it."
Best juice ever! My kids think its soda but it's only juice with bubbles! Tastes great and much healthier than many options.
"If this was actually going to make Christianity popular, it would've done it the first time around, or the second, or the third...  or you know, any one of the thousands of times throughout history this garbage was brought up and thoroughly debunked."
"The percentage you raised debt in absolute terms is meaningless and misleading.  It's easy to see why this fails if you replace ""debt"" with ""income"".  Imagine Reagan's gets a huge 118% raise going from $11,420/yr to $28,570/yr, while Obama's only gets a meager 27% raise going from $135,620/yr to $172,040/yr.  If Obama was as good as Reagan and got a 118% raise he would be making $339,050/yr. Comparing spending or debt to GDP is more legitimate.  As a percentage of GDP, Obama is spending more than Reagan.  As a percentage of GDP, debt increased by about 20% under 8 years of Reagan.  Under Obama has already exceeded that.  See graphs below:[Spending to GDP percentage](http://www. usgovernmentspending. com/spending_chart_1792_2014USp_15s1li011lcn_F0f) Also, notice before FDR and the new deal, federal spending was about 2. 5% GDP except during wars.  Since WW2 is has averaged about 20%. [~~Spending to Debt~~ Debt to GDP percentage](http://www. usgovernmentdebt. us/spending_chart_1792_2016USp_15s1li011lcn_H0f_Accumulated_Gross_Federal_Debt)Also, Reagan was working with a Democrat controlled House, so the situation was basically reversed of what it is today with regard to spending.  Finally, saying that because Republicans have increased debt they can't criticize Democrats for doing it is wrong and dangerous thinking.  The parties change every year as values change and politicians get replaced."
"I work outside, and around agricultural inputs.  This shirt does pretty much everything you need it to.  I am a bigger individual, and having a tall size that you can tuck in that covers your hind parts it good for all parties concerned.  I would wear these around when I'm not at work if my wife would let me.  Just an awesome shirt that does the job, and fits great."
I was excited to buy this last year staring my no carb diet and it was enjoyable using it for a while but it's too bulky compared to a lot of spirilizers out there. Clean up can be a hassle as well. Still a solid product nonetheless.
thanks to the variety pack i found out what sparkling juices i like the most from the switch soda company.
love it
Great value
"This is Portland, Maine, everybody. Though I'd now surmise that Portland, Oregon might be at 70+ percent."
"Carbonated juice - I worry a bit about the added 'flavoring', wondering if it could be splenda... there is a slight aftertaste.  If they do have sucralose, I'd be disappointed.  At any rate, this beats buying juice and carbonated water and mixing it myself... a nice convenience item that tastes great compared to other products."
People believe in God because they've been trained to.  Being scared of death plays some role in it.  Needing to believe that one's own personal successes and failures won't completely dictate their future plays some part in it.  But mostly it’s because they’ve been trained to based on generations of religion seeping into politics and society.
"Love the colors, hate the pens, they aren't smooth - the price was right for the colors I wanted I suppose but I ended up giving them all away instead of using them for myself!"
Great durable pens. Fine writing.

"We like it alot, very good. I have been looking for something for my son, to get away from soda, this was it. and I started drinking them myself. very good flavor."
"Surely though, the point could be not ""Let's not have any love and grace to this pastor,"" but ""You need to have love and grace, because if you don't have love and grace, you'll wind up doing something loveless and graceless, for example what this pastor said.

I've been using Carhartt pocket t-shirts for a long time now and these are of the same quality and they last for a really long time. This shirt is a replacement for one that I've had for 5 years. Heavier that most inexpensive t-shirts these are absolutely the best!
Size runs big.
Good selection.

I have been purchasing this juice for years for my grandchildren's lunches. They love it.  The cans are thin and fit nicely in lunch bags. I will continue to get this bubbly juice for as long as they are in school.  Have a few years to go yet.
Love it!! It was exactly as advertised.  Highly recommended!
