Liked the shirt and material.  It was a bit oversized for an XL fit.
"I was delighted to receive a gallon of Tuscan Whole milk as a gift from my girlfriend for Christmas, however upon opening the bottle and pouring a glass I knew something was amiss. It didn't have the same full bodied taste and satin like texture that defines Tuscan whole milk. It tasted somewhat healthy and a little watered down.After doing some research I discovered that a company in Shenzhen has been repackaging Tuscan 2% milk (green cap & label) in gallon milk containers with counterfeit whole milk labels (red label & red cap). From the outside you can tell the counterfeit from the real ones because the counterfeit milk labels are missing the star above the cow. Also the red cap seemed a little pinkish to me."
"Oh mercy, I was so relieved when I discovered the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer! In the long past before, all I could manage to cut my bananas with was a corded power saw, which lead to a divorce, two deceased cats, three disfigured children, and worst of all - uneven banana slices on my cereal.I used to cry and shriek with rage, hurling the power saw away seeing the abominable slices it would create. Little Annie loves the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer as well, because it doesn't cause her to lose any more digits when she wants cereal! (MY little girl slices her OWN bananas for breakfast. I beat her silly with a spoon last time she cried 'Daddy, daddy, the saw scares me! I won't raise a coward, no I won't!) She's so grown up and independent, cutting her own bananas like a beautiful and semi-fingerless lady. Thank you Hutzler for making life so wonderful!"
"These 8-oz. cans of delicious juice combinations are healthful and energizing.  They are pure juice with no additives, including no added sugar.  The carbonation makes them very refreshing."
This a fun and flavorful to add vegetables in your diet. Its pretty easy to clean and stores away easily.
"Quite large, easily started with newspaper. Rust begins almost immediately."
I had ordered 2 tall XL pocket tees. I got tall XL pocket tee and 1 Reg XL long sleeve pocket tee.
"I found this product to be a bit glitchy at first, but once I downloaded the software update, it worked like a dream. Perhaps too well, as it has been seen around my house cutting all sorts of other fruit in a most promiscuous manner."
"My experience with Carhartt shirts is that they run a little large. I usually buy XL, but in this case a Large fits really well through the shoulders and they are relatively long so they stay tucked in no matter how much bending or reaching that may be done. They tend to be a little heavier than most so they tend to wear really well and keep their colors after many washes."
"I don't know about a jar of honey, but when I look at the ridiculous infrastructure we've set up here in the US and the resources wasted in the name of ""homeland security"", I'd have to agree that Bin Laden may very well have won the bigger war.  The 60 minutes story last night about the trials that are going to be held in Guantanamo after 12 years so that ""justice"" can be dispensed shows me just how fucked up we've become after those attacks.  We are still *terrified* apparently and since 9/11 was an act of terrorism..."
"This is great for starting charcoal. I don't know how I got by without it. Buy the Weber Firestarting cubes, too."
"The argument has some serious anachronisms that prevent it from being as effective as it could be. To begin with, the word *protest* [derives](http://www. etymonline. com/index. php? term=protest) from the word *protestari* from Latin which meant ""avowal, pledge, solemn declaration. ""  The first [usage](http://www. etymonline. com/index. php? term=protest&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) as ""statement of disapproval"" is attested in 1751 and is very clearly related to the side-effects of some of the more radical offshoots of the Protestant Reformation.   However, the contemporary sense at the time was very clearly that it was ""a solemn declaration of reformation of the Church around the Gospel's message,"" not as a call to be ""*always criticizing* everything that isn't us"" like this article seems to imply. That anachronism is borne out when we examine what the 15th Century Reformers actually did.   The majority of the Protestant Reformers specifically set out a vision of an ""Evangelical Catholic Church"" that corrected the errors they were protesting.   Furthermore, they generally retained the Creeds and Church Fathers and taught there is ""One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. ""  The clear intention was only to repair the unity of the Church around the Gospel's promise which felt had been disrupted by the abuses in the Medieval Church.   Therefore, this is why most Protestants are not ""protestants"" like this article describes, as the article itself noted. The notion of ""reformational catholicism"" is already inherent in most non-radical Protestant philosophies.   There were, of course, many radicals who sought to continue the reforms in ways that were against the original intent of the Reformers.   These radicals were clearly criticized by these same Reformers, however."
"Jillette's video has so many more views because he is much, much more famous than the other two. Interesting article but the opening saying that it has more views because it hits a nerve is space that could have been used better."
"I accidentally left my pen lying around and my teenage son used it. He has started to grow breasts and lose his  facial hair. This is a real problem for him since it had just started looking nice. He also wants to watch cooking and design shows all of a sudden. If I had only put that pen in a safe place, like the tampon box! I don't blame Bic, I blame myself. The guilt of being such a careless mom is overwhelming. I think I will write my feelings down in my journal with my awesome, feminine pen as I cry myself to sleep another night. Be careful, moms!"
Perfect
"This reminds me of when Catholic adoption agencies shut their doors rather than be forced to follow non-discrimination laws. Only this time it's so big that I doubt they'd be willing to shut down rather than give in.   It will be interesting to see what happens.My boss's religion really shouldn't be able to affect my healthcare.   Edit; http://www. whitehouse. gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-women-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutionsAh, so the issue is these aren't considered to be religious enough to get this special treatment.   Hopefully they can get that fixed."
"This shirt is made with great material. I found it much harder to cut the sleeves off this shirt than my collection of Walmart wolf shirts. It has become my church shirt, the wife (cousin) loves it."
"I was given this three wolf shirt as a 30th birthday present. I had planned on trying it out over the weekend perhaps while yachting off the coast of the Côte d'Azur. However the wait was simply intolerable. I received the shirt on a Sunday, by Tuesday my mind had become completely fixated on it. At night I would stay up late staring at it through the meticulously fitted plastic wrap that separated us. It entered my dreams, I standing at the precipice of a great mountain, wolves gathered all around me 100,000 strong, I their alpha, the wind blowing through my hair, wearing the shirt. By Friday I could no longer restrain myself. My office permits casual wear at week’s end. I decided three immaculately drawn wolves wouldn’t be too out of place amongst a sea of poorly concealed midriff and non designer jeans. My mind was set, there was no turning back.I must admit that when I unraveled the plastic and finally handled the fabric I was somewhat underwhelmed. Yes the illustration of the wolves and moon was of staggering beauty but the stitching and basic construction seemed fairly average. I decided to wear it without an undershirt which in hindsight may have been a mistake. I took a glance of myself in the mirror, snapped two perhaps three selfies and was off to work. Undeniably I looked good but it was hard to say if I looked any better than normal. I have been going to the gym regularly and my muscular physique created perfect lines though most every t-shirt I own.The thirty minute drive to work was uneventful. However when I entered the office a sudden and unmistakable feeling of ill-being betook me. I felt nauseous and weak, I broke out into a fever, sweat running down my face and dripping on the floor like the great basketball player Patrick Ewing. Though I am a superb playground player I never took the time to develop my skills to a professional level. And while I likely break the six foot threshold when I’m careful to maintain perfect posture, I was not endowed with Patrick’s vertical prominence. This coupled with the fact that I had been several months removed from my last conquest on the courts led me to believe that my current state was irregular and furthermore caused almost certainly by an adverse reaction to my birthday present.I felt trapped! I was in no position to drive back home nor had I any spare clothing. If I had worn an undershirt perhaps I could rid myself of this vile aliment but I had not taken the forethought. With no escape in sight I took to my work, trying to put my condition out of mind. There wasn’t an immediate or sudden change but I gradually started to feel better; not only a return to normalcy but a significant improvement over my standard consciousness. I had tremendous energy and my mind was completely clear. I no longer needed my glasses to see! I could easily read the print of times new roman size 10 from a distance of three to four hundred feet. My sense of smell was exaggerated. A momentary whiff of a particular Gruyère de Comté alluded the entire history of its aging process. If I put my ear to the ground I could hear conversations occurring in China! Unfortunately, I did not develop the ability to understand Chinese.If anything the remarkable qualities of this shirt had been undersold. I could no longer imagine ever wearing anything else. I logged on to Amazon to buy thirteen more. I figured I would need two for each day of the week. One would soak all of the sweat from the initial adjustment phase and the other presumably would last me the rest of the day. I wondered if they made wolf pajamas or if I could even get any sleep with them on. This was the greatest day of my life; a true turning point, nothing would ever be the same again.I turned my attention to work. I had been for over a year engaged in a highly important project. There was weeks or perhaps months of detailed research and writing left to be done. However the wolf shirt had bestowed totally clarity on everything that had once seemed elusive. All at once it came to me, a blueprint of the entire process. The QWERTY keyboard was an ineffective tool, too slow for the speed in which my brain was now working. So I devised a completely novel method of writing shorthand and a computer program which could translate this shorthand into regular English.I don’t remember much of what happened next but after working for what seemed like several years straight though was actually probably only around forty minutes I was finished; months or at least weeks of work done within a matter of less than an hour. I knew this accomplishment was a rare feat and I needed to share it not only with my direct superiors but with those at the very top of the company. I directed my email to the CEO and President and of course the Chief General Council for whom I felt a momentary empathetic sadness. It was now a certainty that come Monday I would be replacing him at his post. This sadness was quickly gone as I realized those who did not have a wolf shirt were hardly worthy of much other than janitorial work or perhaps teaching.I got home that night at about 11pm, mentally and physically drained. I took off the shirt and gradually returned to normal consciousness. Though it was a little difficult to drift back into my regular self it was also relieving to be unburdened of the super physical and metal powers which I had possessed all day. Overall I would say it was a very successful first use of an extraordinary shirt. That is until the next morning when I got feedback on the previous day’s work. It seems as though my email was simply several hundred pages of the word “woof” spelled with a varying amount of o’s and f’s along with a few YouTube videos of wolves chasing things and a lengthy documentary on how unicorns are real. I can’t fault the shirt, the shirt is great. I mean… three wolves; remarkable how it all fits on there. I just wish they had put proper warnings on the packaging. My recommendation, definitely get this shirt, just be careful, make sure to wear an undershirt or have another shirt to change into, and don’t take the chance and wear it to work no matter how tempting that may be."
"""""""Daddy,"""" Stephen said, his voice starting to break on the other end of the line. He was only three and a half years old but the pain in his voice was unmistakable and pure, the way it always tends to be with children of a young age. """"My cereal... milk... I need milk...""""I knew then that this was a serious matter. I'd been there before myself. A victim of an unfortunate circumstance decades prior where the last bit of Cinnamon Toast Crunch I had poured myself had been tainted by the last bit of milk we had left in the house. Milk that had turned nearly three days prior. I realized it after the second spoonful, tasting what seemed to me like a mixture of old, sharp cheese and cinnamon toast.It didn't help matters either to picture myself pouring the last of the milk into my coffee that morning without a second thought. I was usually good about things like that, leaving enough of something in particular for those still in the house when I left for work every morning. But that morning, the call of milk for my coffee was too great.I gripped the phone tightly, the work in front of me long forgotten. I knew I'd have to make a stop at the supermarket on the way home. How much time did I have to wipe away the grief from his undeniably broken heart? I figured I had about an hour, maybe fifty minutes if I left right then and there.""""I'll get you your milk, Stephen."""" I said. """"I'll get you your milk. You can count on it.""""I heard him sniffle once or twice before he handed the phone back to my wife. I knew what she was going to say just as much as I had already known what it was that I had to do.I had to make things right.I stepped off the subway nearly two hours later. A normal day would've guaranteed no more than an hour long ride to get home but I didn't take the blizzard we had just been socked with into account. I spent at least twenty minutes at Times Square with another forty minutes added to the ride at 96th Street. The veins in my temple were throbbing as I walked into the supermarket, flurries of snow falling from my hair and shoulders. The place was a disaster. I saw two women to my left fighting over a length of kielbasa, venom spitting from their mouths in hushed tones. I uttered a silent prayer, hoping I wouldn't find the same sort of scene in the dairy section. I turned into the cool air of the dairy aisle and stopped in my tracks when I saw that there was no milk left.Up until then, I'd never experienced those moments you see in the movies, the ones where all the sound goes out, replaced by only a thudding heartbeat and a high pitched tone that sounds like someone just flatlined in the ER, another recently departed poor soul in a history of departed poor souls. But right then I did. I knew I'd be able to go to a local bodega and get a gallon of milk there but there was something in that moment that defeated me. Old memories flared up and for a moment, strange yet almost comforting in its familiarity, I could taste the rancid, sour sweet taste of dead milk in the back of my throat. The image of me dropping to my knees and screaming up at the ceiling filled my mind and seemed to be in my immediate future when a flash of movement from the rear of the store caught my eye, stopping all train of thought.A flash of white color.I started moving through the aisle, pushing past an old man trying to make sense of the day's offerings in the circular. The man I saw emerge from the back of the supermarket was wearing a white butcher's coat, stained with long dried blood from the day's work. I felt a sense of disappointment, believing that I'd fallen victim to my own hopes, that is, until I looked down. He was pushing a hand truck, loaded with crates of fresh Tuscan milk stacked on top of one another.Sound rushed back into my world, the sound of my heartbeat retreating to the back of the auditorium that was my everyday world. I didn't exactly storm over to him but my footsteps thudded on the ground, footsteps of a man with a mission.I yanked a gallon out of the crate by the handle, feeling the ice cold milk inside greet me with its coolness. I knew what it would taste like because I'd had it before, not just once but many times over the course of my life. It was the perfect thing to add to a bowl of cereal and better yet, it was still fresh with at least another week and a half to go before it would turn. More than enough time to get home to my son so he could have his cereal in the proper fashion. With good old fashioned, vitamin D laced milk.""""Thank you,"""" I said to the man in the white coat, patting him on the back and ending it with a hearty squeeze of the shoulder. """"Thank you."""" He stood there, not really knowing what to say for a moment before beginning to restock the milk section. He never took his eyes from me but I think he knew. He knew that there was more at stake here than what it looked like. The milk wasn't for me and he knew that. Maybe he had a boy of his own, maybe not. But he knew.On the way home, I felt a sense of relief. I'd gotten Stephen his milk and the people at Tuscan would be happy to know that they helped a little boy get the smile on his face back. I smiled.Above, the snow continued to fall from the sky. Somewhere a dog barked and somewhere else a car horn tooted away. It all sounded like music to my cold ears."""
"I'm not suggesting this is a bad product, but be aware.  Most 12 oz cans of pop have 140 calories.  This 8 oz can of Switch has 120 calories.  That's why some people find it ""disgustingly"" sweet, because there's more sugar in each sip than pop.  (Yes, it's fruit sugar, not refined cane or beet, but that's a separate discussion.)  For comparison, an 8.4 oz can of Izze has 90 calories.  Personally I would not drink either Switch or Izze on a regular basis, so as a treat, I like Switch."
"What a piece of cheap, plastic junk. So not worth purchasing! Returned it. The suction pads barely have much suctioning strength and since it's made of light, cheap plastic, it shifts a lot as you push the vegetable through the blade. Do not recommend. I would prefer if this same concept were made in a heavier, sturdier material, with the option to be clamped in on a surface or with better suction pads."
"Perfect for my daughter's lunch. It keeps everything separate,  and it has a ""dunking spot"" for her ketchup."

"Why would you buy this, and what would you do with it?"
Good quality easy to use.
Super smooth writing and great colors.
"A joy to use, exceeds expectations."
"The price is a little high but you cant find them anywhere else, also the apple is not included which was a huge disappointment to my daughter"
"Not sure why people are all up in arms about the title.  Religious references almost always over shadow anything else that surround it.  That, and if you actually read the very short article, it's clear the whole Biblical method of rearing the child was the focus.  I think the homeschooling tid bit is just there to show how controlling these parents were at all times, and why the child never had a chance to get help from a typical source, like a teacher. None of this has a negative stigma to homeschooling in general."
can you block all those hashtags?   I get more aggravated by those than I should.
"Love this! Only tip is after you spiralize anything that has a high water content, let it sit on a paper towel in the fridge to remove water (about an hour). No more pasta for this gal!"
"Great price! I think I paid around $8 for about 20 pens, which is way more affordable than brick and mortar stores in my area. The pens write very nicely, and are an affordable alternative to the grading pens I was using."
"The products are good for a substitute for soda. But, they still have a powerful sweet taste. If you like a more subtle taste, I'd try Izzes. They are more expensive, but still better."
"Sure it tastes great, but I would hardly call it healthy.  Your kids will not be any less fat for drinking this as an alternative to soda.  Sugar free soda is actually a healthier alternative.  No, it doesn't have all the vitamins that you find in juice, but most people get all they need in their regular diet.  No wonder childhood obesity is such a problem in the U.S. if people think high calorie juice is healthy."
I thought even a child could understand that giving money to rich people doesn't make poor people any better off.

Love these InkJoy pens. They write every time. No skipping.
"Yeah because Obama is not at all a communist.   He also hasn't focused his entire life, including jobs, friends, mentors, ""religion"" and education exclusively around it.   He is a just a regular, good old capitalism loving, American patriot."

"Awesome ok?  I was like looking for a totally rad shirt you know? And I was given this by this chick I know who like totally was into it.  So I was like - cool, I'll wear it and then I didn't know what else I should wear because it is so cool and I wanted to make sure that anything else would be like equally cool so I tossed on my fav cut-offs and my Birky's and it was like they were made for each other, you know?  Get this.  Then I was like asked by my bud Zax to gig with his band - Blo-fest, his new band not the one he was in the other week, and I said okay and I showed up wearing this and my Birk's and everyone was totally freaked out when I was shreading on my cow bell.  The frickin' bar dude gave me like two free beers cuase of the coolness and I was like thinking that it was totally because of this, you know.  Then Zax asked me where did you get that and I was blown away that the chick might be one of his old sweets - unreal right?Then Zax got all po'd because he was like thinking that this rag should be like all his and I said no way because he couldn't even tell me the babes name and everything and I was all like ""dude - what up"" and all.  Then we spot this other chick who liked the shirt and she used to room with this other one that gave me this and all and she said it was totally mine.Zax was like ""what ever"" so - were cool."
"I had been writing with gel pens a lot when I got these, I wanted to use ball point pens instead.  I like the gauge a lot, and the colors are bright and fun.  They write really well and are comfortable as any pen is.  You go get an assortment, but it's two or three of each color, not one of each like the picture.  Definitely worth it."
"My fiancee is 6'5"" and 315 lbs, and he is really hard on his clothes due to his job. These shirts are a bit spendier than others but well worth it. No holes or rips so far. He loves them!"
"Disappointed.  Not sure what the hype was, I bought this based on reviews here and on several blogs.  I find the blade difficult to replace.  I found that the suction cups did not stay put.  I found the handle awkward to use.  I found the plastic slightly flimsy.  I thought the under storage would be a great idea, but I end up cleaning all the blades after every use.  I found I am the only member of my family who can use it without cussing.  And the first time I used it I did carrots and the carrots stained the plastic.  (I used beets on my Oxo brand spiralizer and that didn't stain, and beets are much a guaranteed stain.)  I personally preferred the Oxo brand spiralizer, it seems like they took some time to figure out what would make a better spiralizer and implemented those changes."
Like one of those edugames?  Sounds good really.
Best shirt ever.
My kids love these.  Cheaper than paying school prices.
"Very much worth every penny. No more stinky BBQ! Just put a few drops of cooking oil on a newspaper and loosely crumble it up. Put the paper in first, then coals, light and wait about 15 minutes for ready to cook fuel."
Putin deserves it FAR more than Comrade Oblowme...
"an excellent pen!Love the colors, and the smoothness. At first I thought they were a little full of themselves naming a pen ""joy"" but I am totally on board, now. Love these! I still love my very expensive gel pens, but these are great and I don't mind sharing with kids, scouts, students, etc. the last a long thine, and I am exceptionally pleased with the price!"
Funny how religion needs to have a non-suicide clause in the first case.   I guess the mom should have gone ahead and murdered the girl and then asked god for forgiveness.   That's legit by their twisted rules.
a little wide
"Just ok...ink not as smooth and free flowing as I would like.  Also, pens appear cheaply put together and I've had a couple that just spring apart and won't hold together which makes those ones a total write off.  Decent but certainly not spectacular pens."
"I have been using the banana slicer for nearly two years now. I have fond memories of Model 1 A, an ingenious, if clunky (well, more ""cardboardy"", really) version of these new slicked up models.  I have to say, I love the new upgrades on this model over the 570, or even the 571A.  Really streamlined the curves and sharpened the edges.  The engineering is very precise, down to the smallest detail of removing the bananger (black booger on the end of the banana) without much loss of banana.  They have taken care of most of the safety issues as well, but one must always be reminded ""throw the peel in the trash bin BEFORE you begin to slice"". I can't wait to see tomorrow's model, which is purported to have the jazzed up name of ""572Z"", and may slice longitudinally for ice cream enthusiasts!"
"Great, fill with charcoal sit it on grill burner in about 5 min or less dump it in you charcoal grill spread it out, one foull will cook grilled chicken boston butt, whatever, you want steak use one half full cook 8 steaks np, and never buy lighter fluid to stink up your food again,"
Really good easy to use and clean I'm really loving it and making different things that are fun ❤️❤️❤️
Great value. Quality material.
"I'm actually REALLY surprised that this product got such great reviews. It's nearly impossible to get actual ""noodles"" with cylindrical vegetables like carrots, zucchini and summer squash and you have to PUSH it soo hard. The plastic is the problem.

It should be pointed out that an amendment to Obamacare to allow people to buy prescription drugs from outside the US (a campaign promise of Barack Obama) was proposed (by John McCain of all people) and was killed by Democrats in the Senate at the behest of the Obama whitehouse. Obama actually lobbied to kill his own campaign promise on this issue.
really nice

"I can't say how many stars this gets, I've not had it. But then I didn't purchase it for me, I purchased it (after reading up on it, here on Amazon and elsewhere) for our 13 yr old daughter. She's been drinking Izze for some time now, and I wanted to see if she'd like something I felt was a good alternative. Well, I thought so, but after a case, she said the jury was in - just not as enjoyable as the Izze (variety pack, too), so I won't be repurchasing. It's good, just not for everyone - her words."
If I had a ton of money I'd turn this into a commercial and have it run in prime time over and over and over
Very good
not bad
"I first heard about Switch on Facebook, then saw it being sampled at Costco. My kids love it and I love that it is good *for* them. Instead of a treat made with high fructose corn syrup, they are enjoying something just as delicious (or more-so) with Switch. The flavors are great- and I love that this pack has an assortment of 6 flavors, opposed to the case at Costco that only has 4."
I am a 5'9 450 lb male and ordered two  3xl and these are my favorite shirts--the black fits a bit more snug

No way the Republicans go through with it.  It would be disastrous for them at the polls.  I call a total bluff.  I hope to God Obama sees this and offers the nothing.

Doing their best to overwhelm and corrupt local elections.
But is he really going after MLK day or the fact that kids really should get off for Presidents day and Veterans Day?  Growing up my mother would let me stay home on presidents day every year if I wrote a paper on a president and gave it to my teacher.  I love history so it was kinda fun to do as a kid and I learned a little something they wouldn't have taught me otherwise.
Too big and I am still waiting on a Mizzou onsie that I ordered months ago!

"We could solve poverty in this country easily if we wanted to: With a [universal basic income](http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Basic_income).  It's an idea worth spreading, so tell a friend (or ideally, lots of friends)."
Would they need to be college educated?  http://www. youtube. com/watch? v=lbEfV05tJz8
"I believe a universal minimum income in the US used to be a republican proposal to get rid of cash welfare and food stamps and all the rest.  I may be wrong about that but I believe in the 60s, when they believed the federal government had a purpose and taking care of labor relations was essential to the survival of capitalism they proposed a minimum annual income level.  These days though, no that capitalism has nothing to compete with they don't worry about such trivial things, capitalism won that war and there is no American left they have to appease."
"Can't stand Obama.   Agree with him here 100%.  I'm guessing one of the aides had to pull him aside after this.  ""Umm... mister president.... yeah.... ummmm.... """
"&gt;This is because about 10% of Catholic doctrine is derived more from Apostolic Tradition than Sacred Scripture. I've seen this statistic thrown around the sub a few times, and I don't quite understand it.  Isn't 100% of Catholic doctrine from Holy Tradition?  I mean, Holy Tradition is what led to the canonization of the Bible, so that ""90% Biblical"" is just a subgroup of ""100% Tradition""...."

"I bought these drinks in an effort to reduce the amount of processed sugars we consume. Some of the flavors were more enjoyable than others, but on the whole they tasted too sweet for me. They actually reminded me of artificially flavored drinks, even though they are not. I prefer the Knudsen sparkling juices, but they are getting harder to find."
Each color fits differently and each color material feels very different.

The t-shirt is slightly larger than I expected. I usually wear Large with any shirt but with this one I would buy a size smaller of what you actually are.
It's really crazy.  I liked looking at how many countries had debt as greater than 100% of their GDP.
They fit well and wear great. Very nice shirt to wear when it's hot.  Be warned they do seem to stain very easy. Then Again it a work shirt.
Yummy substitute for sugary soft drinks.  Very tasty and pure fruit juice.

"Wow, these are ridiculously good! I subscribe to these to make sure I have enough for my son's lunch box.  They fit perfectly in his soft, padded lunch box.  I treat myself to one every now and then.  These and the Izze drinks are the only carbonated drinks in the house.  The variety of flavors makes for a nice surprise in the lunch box too.  Like a box of chocolates... you never know what you're gonna get! : )"
"Great, but it was a little small. I'm 300 and 6 foot 5, so I dunno what I expected ordering online. Asked for a size bigger and it arrived promptly no questions asked."

"Great product. Had a hard time keeping charcoals lit due to airflow issues in my grill. With just a few pieces of newspaper, the coals are glowing red hot within 10 minutes.Going to start using lighter cubes instead and I'm sure it'll be perfect with those.Bigger than I thought it was going to be, but you can put any amount of charcoal in it and it functions great."
"My kids love this stuff and it is healthy with Vitamin C compared to other drinks.  It is comparable to Izze which my kids also like but we like to SWITCH it up, LOL, and this was great!"
Why only rely on a single mechanism of control when you could layer dozens over each other?
"I LOVE this product! I want to eat less starch and more vegetables and this does the trick! I have spiralized zucchini as spaghetti, cucumber as frilly, light salad, sweet potato for oven fries, yellow squash for side dish, rutabaga as an add-in for slaw.... and the list goes on! My daughter is a vegetarian and I am buying one for her to add more textures and interest to her meals. She loved my zucchini spaghetti and asked for the one I am getting for her. Any fruit or vegetable can be used and I love the 3 blades. One makes a ribbon, one makes small diameter spaghetti and the 3rd one makes a larger spaghetti shape. I love mixing apples, carrots and cabbage for a new salad base! The only thing that I don't love is the fact that the machine is not stable. It is plastic and the stickers don't stick to my counter. No problem, though, as I can hold with one hand and spiralize with  the other hand. EASY to use and fast!! Easy to clean and change blades, too!"
"The sleeves are super long. The shirt is huge.  I'm 6'4""and a 2x looks ridiculous. Even after wash and dry.  Expensive rag."

Very tasty - I just wish I could get to choose the flavors in my variety pack.  They have a true fruit flavor.
The taste was great and I liked the variety that was included in the case. The size was just the right amount for my elderly mother and my great nephew who is three. We will definitely be ordering more.

"First things first.  The instructions that come with the device are a little sparse so I will be creating a website with some video demonstrations.  As mentioned in other reviews, it is best to peel the bannana prior to slicing.  For those of you whose Bannanas are bending the wrong way, just use the slicer while looking in a mirror.

"This is the chimney starter you need. The metal is solid, not flimsy. It does the job solidly, which is a great thing when you're handling extremely hot chunk charcoal.  This starter fits pretty well on my side burner on my grill (propane), if you're looking for that as a feature to start your charcoal. I would still advise you to use hand protection, given the heat involved (better safe than sorry)."
taste better than juicy juice. not as strong flavored. carbonation is nice. my new fav real juice. wish i had them locally. oh well.
I love it. I use it almost daily and its very easy to use.
"This product is fine to use in an egalitarian, non-stratified society.  However speaking from an anthropological viewpoint, I must stress the importance of cultural awareness when using this product.  The product is built to make uniform slices, which is fine in America or other western european societies.  However this product should not be used in a stratified, hierarchical culture.  For example, the formation of uniform slices in a Japanese workplace could cause undue shame and stress among workers.  By giving everyone the same size, you are implying that the coworkers are of equal value.  You are lowering the status of the boss and raising the status of the employee.  That can cause one to lose ""face"" and dishonor the employer and his family.  It is a cultural slap in the face.  Unless Hutzler creates a banana slicer with moveable slots (to ONLY be used by a culturally aware individual who understands all of the nuances,) it is best to leave this product be.  So feel free to share your banana with all of your American coworkers, but leave well enough alone in other societies."

I love this item. Clean up is easy. Cleans great!!!  Beware the blades are very sharp. People who have problems breaking the handle are most likely forcing the vegetable instead of letting the normal pressure and blades do the work. I love all the different ideas to create dishes. My next dish tonight will be a carrot ribbon salad with curry dressing. It makes cooking and preparing dishes fun.
Good quality shirts. Will purchase these again.
"Effective camouflage patterns aren't bullshit.   I think UCP (the grey/green digital pattern) was bullshit and somebody probably lined a pocket or two in the process.   But a corrupted system should not force Soldiers to wear substandard equipment, especially equipment that highlights their position to armed opponents. Second point.   The camouflage pattern that the Army is looking to adopt over UCP is already employed in Afghanistan by the Army and the Air Force.   The money has largely been spent, now it's just spreading it to the non-deployed Army."

"These pens write extremely smooth!!! They are also very comfortable. Working as an office manager, I write A LOT during the day. My only big complaint about these pens that will withhold me from purchasing them again is that every time I write with one I get ink ALL over my hand (AND I'M A RIGHTY)!! Not recommended for Left-handers or someone in an office setting where they are writing a lot with little time for drying."
Great well fitting shirt
Great pens and gorgeous colors!
"I have been looking into spiralizer kitchen tools for a while now. I am into healthier eating and have been seeing lots of recipes for zucchini noodles, all made using a spiralizer. The compact design of this tool apeals to me as someone who has a small kitchen. It is easy to put together and clean as well. This spiralizer is great at making zucchini noodles but on a very small scale. If you are just looking to make a single serving or add a garnish, this is your tool. If you are looking to make an entire bowl of zucchini noodles this is not your tool, I'd invest in a larger crank model. I think I will upgrade to a more heavy duty spiralizer now that I know my family enjoys the zucchini noodles and I'll be making them on a more regular basis."
"While this thing is pretty cool in that you can make nice spiral garnishes, I don’t think it is very useful for much else.  I have a spiralizer with a hand crank that will spiralize vegetables readily, and for $10 more it is a better deal than this one. Paderno World Cuisine A4982799 Tri-Blade Plastic Spiral Vegetable Slicer It will turn multiple zucchini into a spaghetti substitute in short order.  This hand-held one however, while being more convenient to store since it is not so bulky, requires far too much manual labor to use.  It requires that you push on the vegetable yourself while turning it endlessly since the slices are so thin.  The blade height is set so low that it only turns out about an 1/8” thick spiral at most.  If you are not pushing consistently, the spirals get sheared off.  I tried it on cucumbers, potatoes, carrots, and zucchini.  The cucumber doesn’t stay centered since the center of the cuc is soft.  Potatoes worked well, but they are fairly stiff and hard to turn once the potato is short enough to be inside the cup.  The spikes on the lid don’t really help because there is just too much friction between the cut end of the potato and the inside of the cup.  The carrot was almost a joke:  the pressure required to spin and cut this hard vegetable at all was way too much work.  I could see using this for small garnishes, even milk chocolate spirals, but certainly nothing like creating a spaghetti substitute on a regular basis.  Honestly, it is most likely to get relegated to the back of the cabinet and forgotten."
I can't believe how fast you get hot coals with this chimney.  Put a few brickets in the bottom with lighter fluid.  Light.  Add more brickets and in about 10 minutes you have charcoal that is ready to cook with.  Much better and faster than other chimneys I have used in the past.
Great for school Kids & Others
Great little tool.  I make zucchini noodles often and it's perfect!  Good quality.
"I've only had this product for a short time, but it appears very well made.  High quality materials.  Good design.  I definitely recommend this product."
Love it!
"Having spent hours in stopped traffic on routes that are 90 miles apart, and watching so many cars with a single rider in them, I think that we need to stretch ourselves a little and devise rail that is going to be faster and better than cars.  I think that we need to tip our hats to the concept that buses are not the same experience as a car or a train - they are usually the equivalent of steerage because they are limited in size and thus can't offer amenities like snacks or the ability to stretch your legs.  We need to try and understand the costs in a more equal manner - is the cost of building, maintaining, and patrolling our highways built in to any cost comparison when rail is deemed ""more expensive""?  Or are the costs just less visible to cars, because you're only thinking about the cost of gas to fill your tank?  Using federal reimbursement rates, the cost for a 90-mile car trip would be $50 one-way - that is the estimated cost of gas plus depreciation.  Now assume that tolls are a fair approximation of the cost of maintenance of the highway - tolls can be $5-20 per car for the same trip (including things like bridges).  I just priced a 90-mile route and was quoted $21 by Amtrak.  That means for up to about 3 people, rail is more cost-effective on its face - however that does neglect the cost to get to/from the stations.  It is at least competitive for a party of 2. The main problem is that the duration of the trip is over 3 hours.  But does it have to be?  Why can't the train go 100 MPH?  That would cut travel down to a competitive level."
Did they get arrested for trespassing and blocking traffic?  Sounds like they were breaking the law to me.

"This shirt shrank only after two washing, and I dry on low heat or hang dry. I also noticed each shirt is made in a different location...Honduras, Gautamala, Mexico etc. For some reason each colors fabric is a different thickness, the Navy Blue shirts are always extra thick and shrink too much...I love these shirts but am getting annoyed at the inconsistent quality of the fabric otherwise I would rate 5 stars"
Very pleased!

I'll use my mandolin or a knife.I was drawn in because my cooking club recommended it.  Also, I liked the idea that I could eat zucchini squash and pretend was pasta and maybe eat healthier or not eat as much carb.  But, zucchini squash is not pasta, in any way, shape or form.  And the thought of putting good home made spaghetti sauce on mushy cooked zucchini seems like such a waste.I sent it back."
One of the best purchases I've made to make grilling easier. Simple to use and does exactly what it is supposed to.

"I purchase these after reading so many good reviews. I was surprised to find out that they are so SWEET don't get me wrong they are not bad tasting at all is just I don't really like sweet drinks I prefer them to have a watered down taste or a light refreshing taste. These are all very sweet like syrup my daughter only liked the orange, my mother liked the lemon but the rest we gave them away."
Works great and very easy to clean.

As a resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania this doesn't surprise me.  We may be in the north east of the country but our government acts like they're from the deep south.
"After reading all the great reviews before I bought it, I'm a bit disappointed. Mostly, I wanted to spiralize squash. The squash I had on hand weren't very large, and were organic. One reason I bought this particular one is that it seemed like it'd be the best spiralizer for someone with MS and weakness in the hands. Not so much. So, first thing - it was really difficult to get the squash to stay. In fact, it wouldn't. I had to try to hold with one hand and turn the crank with the other. When I began, that didn't work, either. After that, I cut the squash in half, hoping it would stay then. It still didn't. I tried holding the thinner half and spiralizing. That was a total fail! I was about to give up when I decided to try turning the skinny half on it's side. VIOLA! That works. I still had to hold it and guide it with one hand, turning the crank with the other, but finally spirals formed. The thicker/fatter half worked a little better, but still definitely a two hand job with one guiding the vegetable. That's hard to do because of my hands, especially the cranking motion. I needed to pause between.Anyways, I could only really rate this 3 stars because of how much trial and error and difficulty to get it to work. Even then, I'm not hugely impressed with the results. Nothing like the picture (not that I actually expected it to look that pretty, of course). I'd say I recommend it with some reservation in saying it works ok. I ended up not being able to spiralize a decent amount of the squash, at least, in my opinion. It was enough for me to probably chop up and make 2-3 pieces out of each one (I used 3 small ones).For cleaning, that part was very easy. I was able to wash it in the sink without any problem. The pieces didn't get stuck anywhere that I noticed (so far), and the three blades cleaned up easily, too."
Way too wimpy - vegetables kept falling off - couldn't make it work at all.
Pity they got rid of the rainbow graph of institutionalized fearmongering.  Obama could probably benefit from bumping it up to orange or magenta or whatever.

"Pretty much the same here.  I remember when Bitcoins went above $10 (I think they even peaked at around $30) and stayed there for a while, but then dropped to around $4-5.  Back then there was a lot of discussion on Bitcoin forums whether it would be a good investment to just buy a bunch of Bitcoins and sit on them, hoping that their price would increase.  The general consensus was pretty much: ""nah, you might double your money in a few years if you're lucky, but that's about it"". Who would have thought that you could profit 1000% in just a couple of years? (IIRC, I have about 0. 16BTC in my wallet acquired by mining (haven't used Bitcoin in ages) and back when I earned that, it wasn't really worth anything, but apparently now even that would be worth around $80.  Crazy. )"

"Here I am struggling everyday for social acceptance when a recently successful cousin of mine took pity on me and told me the source of his power. After sending me the link to this product I promptly spent my begged changed on ordering one. The most exciting day of my life since I saw that one lady breast feeding in the park finally arrived 8 days later when the package arrived in the mail. I tore it open, put on the shirt, walked outside with a smile as wide as the Atlantic Ocean on my face. Then the disappointment came. At first I thought nothing changed but, then I realized that in fact the Three Wolf Moon shirt was having a polarizing effect, people, not just women, were actually going out of their way to avoid me instead of just ignoring me. I don't know if it's just my bad luck counteracting it's promised magic or if I got a defective piece or what. The only reason I give it a 5-star rating is because now, when I wear it, flies and mosquitos leave me alone too, ah well, silver lining I guess."
Great product

"It's hard to come up with a concise reason why the US is as loony as it appears to be.  Its like a combination of willing ignorance, lack of leadership, and the glorification of selling people out for your own profit.  There are other reasons too, they are just escaping my train of thought for the moment.  That all said, despite all the gloom and doom that every talking head is trying to earn a buck from, consider that things have been worse.  People have been rounded up, dressed in attractive uniforms, armed with firearms and then marched off to a field in northern France to be ground into mulch.  People have dropped in droves from the flu.  There has been wholesale eradication of people solely because they prayed to the same God but in a different way.

Bought this to use with my new smoker and wow was I impressed with how quickly the charcoal was ready to use. The charcoal stays inside the chimney starter without falling out and makes it so easy to transfer it to you grill or smoker. You can get a very nice amount of charcoal started at one time and it burns at a consistent rate since the chimney starter burns the charcoal evenly. I'm very pleased with how well it works!!!

"Since my teenagers really liked the The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and the The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), we thought we would try the Grape Flavor.  We were disappointed. Although still drinkable, it is just not the equal of other flavors of Switch.The positive is that the beverage is all-natural, and packaged in the smaller-than-regular-12-ounce soda cans. It also has less carbonation than regular grape soda, which is a nice change.  But the negative is that the Grape flavor cannot hold a candle to the the two other flavors we have enjoyed.  It is on the sour side and leaves a slight unpleasant aftertaste.  Not at all the satisfying, smooth and true fruit taste of the other two Switch flavors which we have tried.I cannot recommend this flavor, although I still like the brand and plan to sample some other flavors.  I would definitely order the Tangerine/Orange and the Black Cherry again."

Well, unless Tuscan milk is supposed to be warm and taste like the smell of a dumpster in July, it's bad milk. That's not to say it's 'bad' as milk, per se, if it was fresh, but it arrived in a regular cardboard box and sat in the sun on our doorstep all day until we got home from work and it just tasted foul. The hamburger was not so great either.I've never traveled out of the country except to Mexico and Key West,(OK, that's technically still the US), but is the milk in Tuscany supposed to be hot and stink like this?  Is the milk of other regions of Italy, like the Piedmont, Umbria or Lombardy any better? Same deal?The delivery was fast but the stink and taste cost this product three stars."
This is great and the second one i bought as a gift.  They work great and don't require any chemicals and the  charcoal is ready faster.

"I agree with all of the other 1 star reviews here.  In my case, the shirt fits OK, but the pocket is crooked and is just about so far to the side that its in my armpit.  I'm finding another brand.Carhartt definitely should have increased the price instead of sacrificing quality."
I eagerly drank this as soon as it arrived and it tasted like distilled water. Fortunately I grew up around dairy products and figured out the problem. Update the firmware BEFORE drinking the milk. Hopefully they will start shipping it updated soon.

"I love this as an additional tool in the kitchen. It is fun to vary the veggies we use and have lower-carb meals. It is easy to use and clean. The only reason it doesn't get used more often is that it is large and I must put it away after every use--if it were a counter-top staple, I think we'd use it multiple times a week."

These shirts are a little stiff when you first get them but after a few washes they start to break in and are very comfortable. The front pocket is very large which is nice if you like to carry a note pad like I do. Highly recommend for a work shirt!
"I know lots of folks are downright ecstatic with this product right out of the box, but frankly I was a bit disappointed at first. After I spent several frustrating hours reducing several dozen bananas to a messy mush whilst attempting to slice them, a light bulb went off in my head and I decided to try . . . . drumroll . . . .

"I really like these pens and I love the variety of colors.  I like that each one has it's own unique color and even the ""wilder"" colors aren't inappropriate for everyday writing!  I tend to use the purple frequently and it's great!  I love that they included multiples of each color with the largest duplicates being in blue/black since those are the most often used colors.  I keep a couple of them in my purse for quick access as they are affordable and of great quality!  I will say if the paper isn't really smooth, the pens can skip just a bit - but usually scribbling a little will get it to flow better!"
"Fill this one up and you have enough hot coals to fill both the charcoal holders on the large Weber grills. I have used fluid forever, this is a nice alternative but if you are going to reuse your unburned charcoal you will still need lighter fluid. One drawback if using crumpled newspaper as suggested to light under the charcoal is you will have a lot of loose paper soot floating around that you will want out of your grill before using.I have not tried it with the Weber FireStarters yet but will likely prefer those over the crumpled papers.Well built, big and rugged!"

"Sure, it's easy -with the wisdom of hindsight- to imagine that the creation of this tool could had been made by any John Doe.Well, it wasn't.A smal portion of the US GNP was spent in the development of the Hutzler by the homonymous foundation to arrive at model number 571. Let us not forget the five hundred and seventy failed attempts at getting it right. Nor the tens of thousands of hours and bananas it took to perfect the final design.Dozens of maimed and disfigured test subjects paid a tall prize so that we -today- can hold one of these wonders of engineering in our possession.I won't go into my personal battles or medical drawbacks as a lead team engineer in the Hutzler company. This is a public forum after all, and nobody is interested in tales of heroism or the overcoming of unsurmountable obstacles.What I will say, though; is that the world has paid a great prize to have a Hutzler in the hand. Cherish the moment you acquire one! and pass it on down from generation to generation."

AND YET, the Left seems utterly impervious, if not downright hostile, to the health and well-being of said goose. I've said it before and I'll say it again: The most effective social program ever devised is a paying job in the private sector.  It costs tax-payers nothing.... and it produces tax revenue for gov't.  Private enterprise has lifted literally hundreds of millions of Chinese and Indians out of poverty just in the last 25 years.  Think what it could do in America if it weren't drowning in tax and regulatory over-kill."

"My kids love this sparkling juice, but I have not been as happy with it. My main complaint is that at least one of the cans leaked during shipping, which almost ruined the other items in the delivery. It also meant that I had to hose off all of the cans before I could put the drinks out for a party. My other complaint, like many others on here, is that the juices do not taste enough like the flavors they claim to be. They do taste like apple juice that has a splash of other fruit flavoring. My kids don't mind, but I won't buy these for anything other than a rainbow themed party."

"As a Libertarian, I don't like the free pass that this post implicitly gives to Reagan and GWB.   When measuring the percent increase in the national debt, the Reagan and GWB administrations' stewardship of the debt was unconscionable.   The debt was $1. 142 trillion on the date of Reagan's first budget (beginning of Fiscal Year 1982), and it was $2. 857 trillion at the end of his last budget, for a percent increase of 150%.   For GWB, $6. 228 at the start and $13. 562 at the end, for a percent increase of 118%.   As for Obama, $13. 562 at the start and $17. 204 currently, for a percent increase of 27% (but he is only responsible for 4 fiscal years so far).   [Source](http://useconomy. about. com/od/usdebtanddeficit/a/National-Debt-by-Year. htm)Dick Cheney told Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, [""You know, Paul, Reagan proved that deficits don't matter.

The best thing to do would be to stop talking about it, sweep it under the rug, and make sure it never happens again.   I mean, can you imagine if Obama was on track to increase the debt to $33. 905 trillion?!   That's what it would take to be the equivalent of what happened under Reagan.   I disapprove of just about everything Obama and the Democrats are doing these days, but accuracy is important.   Blaming Obama is a losing argument when it comes to the debt."

"I found these in Hannaford. I was skeptical, because I was afraid it would taste like that nasty fruit flavored soda water but decided to give it a try when I saw the ingredients were juice and soda water rather than flavoring and soda water. I loved that ""no added sugar"" actually mean ""no added sweeteners"" and was thrilled this was just juice. I don't by sweetened juice. Juice is sweet enough! I can't tell you how many times I see ""no sugar added"" then read ingredients and find out that the sugar has just been replaced by either artificial sweeteners or other alternative sweeteners that taste like crap and usually disagree with my digestive system. I am really sensitive to the taste of sweetening agents and can tell what's been used. Not having added sweetening beyond the natural sweetness of juice is a huge plus.I have tried the orange/tangerine and the cherry flavors. I love them. I wish the cherry were a bit stronger on the cherry flavor, but I like it. The orange tastes like good orange soda. I have been looking for fruity US soda that isn't chemically and syrupy since coming back from a visit to the Netherlands and being spoiled by fruity soda that is still made with real sugar and at least some juice. Finding these made me very happy. I can enjoy soda again!Don't be fooled by the ""no added sugar"" on the can. This is not a ""diet"" drink, which is a plus for me as someone stays away from anything touted as ""diet"" or ""lite"" (I really need the extra nutrition value and calories, plus ""diet"" on a  beverage is usually synonymous with ""loaded it with fillers and crap that is 100 times worse for you than anything we replaced"") It's fizzy juice. Not sure I'd go so far as to call it ""healthy"" because we're still talking 29g of sugars in one serving, but there are worse things you could drink. It's not worse than drinking juice in terms of ""health"". It is a better choice over typical soda."
"A friend of mine has one of these, so I knew that it worked. It is amazingly simple to use.

They came out wonderful and the cleaning was truly simple...everything is easily accessible and you can reach every part with ease when cleaning. Putting this together was a breeze - I didn't need to use the instructions. This has changed the way we eat certain veggies and has made more dinners more fun."

"Plenty of economists would agree:&gt; A similar survey in 2006 by Robert Whaples polled PhD members of the American Economic Association.  Whaples found that 37. 7% of respondents supported an increase in the minimum wage, 14. 3% wanted it kept at the current level, 1. 3% wanted it decreased, and **46. 8% wanted it completely eliminated. ** [Source](http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Minimum_wage#Surveys_of_economists)People have to realize that this is something even economists are unsure of.  It's not so clear cut."
Always wanted to have a fruit juice with seltzer.
These taste just like the old fashion Grape-ette's I would buy at Whole Foods but they have no sugar and just fruit juice.
Easy to use. Clean up is simple. Machine stay in place when using. Comes with three blades that store in the unit.

"Finally I found it! THE Tuscan milk....OMG! Ever since my aunt Fannie took me to a wonderful spa in Barstow (they used ONLY Tuscan milk in their treatments!) I've been dying to get my hands on this wholesome goodness in a bottle. It makes an incredible facial wash AND bath (please refer to my image #56 above, in the product description). If you're the organic type and want to avoid chemicals it makes the perfect skin wash that makes you feel clean and OH SO SOFT! It's been said that Cleopatra took milk baths, and there's a darned good reason she did. Amazing skin! THAT is what you get with Tuscan milk, and the more you use...the better! I honestly think my wrinkles are going away (my stomach seems flatter and my buttocks is tighter too!), people often comment on my ""creamy"" skin. A friend recently started using it as a hair conditioner, but I haven't tried it yet, will try it with my avocado/banana hair pack I'm mixing up in a few days. Highly recommended at ANY price! You'll need at least 16-20 gal. per milk bath, which may seem to be a bit pricey, but if you want to be a drop dead gorgeous as Cleopatra, it's worth it. Unfortunately, there's NO organic version of this fantastic milk (at the price you're paying it SHOULD BE!) but a little bovine recombinant growth hormone won't hurt your outsides as much as it will your insides. A small price to pay, IMO.Who knows...your breasts may grow too!"
Works well and is an invaluable asset to my Weber Performer Deluxe. Heats the charcoal faster and more efficiently.Highly recommend.
I've been using chimney starters since the 60's. The WEBER is very nice and large. PRICE WAS GREAT!

"The 2012 Employee Incentive Plan (EIP) awards range from 14. 75 and 16 days of additional pay, among the best-ever awarded by the plan.  They are based on 2012 financial results as recorded by Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Boeing Defense, Space and Security and the company as a whole.  The awards, which will be paid beginning Feb.  28, equate to a bonus of between 5. 67% and 6. 15% of an employee’s 2012 eligible earnings. In a press statement today Boeing says in Washington state, 51,820 employees will receive more than $295. 9 million (or roughly $5,000 per person). Not a bad bonus, but I wonder how much that tax break subsidizes."

"I can't tell you how disappointed I was in ""The Switch""!!!  I thought it would be just like another product called ""IZZE"", which I really like!  WRONG!  The cans were only 8.3 ounces, and had just as many calories as the larger bottle of Izze!  Except for the Orange and Grape ones, they also tasted terrible!  The Black Cherry one was especially bad! It was like drinking a juice box with just a little fizz mixed in! Both Izze and The Switch are pricey, but you'll save more buying Izze.  It'll save your taste buds, too!"
I gave it away
Great product. Much easer and faster to get my grill going. I use cowboy charcoal. Works good with it.
Do not bother. Waste of time- very substandard product
I would be interested in seeing how this information was collected.  Nowhere in the article or the poll results is that information given.

"Welcome to /r/libertarian, Glenn Beck."
"As a low carber I see numerous suggestions for substituting ""zoodles"" (noodles made from zucchini) for pasta in recipes. I have tried two other brands of spiralizers and thought that since Paderno is well-known for its larger spiralizer, the handheld one would be a good choice. After using and comparing to my Oxo handheld one, I have mixed feelings about it.The first thing I encountered was difficulty separating the two blades. They must be turned counter clockwise to take apart but I eventually had to use a rubber jar opener to get enough of a grip on one of them to turn them. Even my husband could not get them apart. Once I separated them, I tried each one with zucchini.The device was easy enough to use and cut the vegetable easily. Each blade produced a flat thin spiral. One was wide and one was narrow. I actually prefer the rounded spiral produced by my Oxo because it more closely resembles actual spaghetti. However, I can also see uses for the spirals produced by the Paderno. I will probably use both in the future for different dishes. I think the wide spirals would be great for something deep-fried.I also liked the container with a removable bottom cap. This adds the versatility of either catching the food in the container or for larger quanties, cutting it directly over a larger dish."
Don't forget the oral sex!
"The problem is that Republican messaging on health care is easy for Americans to digest: ""just don't reform it"".   The PPACA is a major improvement that was sorely needed as a starting point for universal coverage but things like ""we need to get rid of your garbage sham insurance so you can get better and cheaper options"" are too complicated to message.   This country's voters only want to be told what they want to hear, and they want to hear messages that aren't longer than a sound bite.   So long as this is true, conservatives running on a platform of ""keep things the way they are"" will have an advantage."
"I've owned a couple of other ""handheld"" spiral cutters and currently own the larger hand-crank Paderno spiral cutter.  So I've had some experience with these devices and eat spiral ""noodles"" a couple of times a week.First, if you've never owned a spiral cutter and you're thinking of trying one, this might be a good choice.  Much better design than most handheld units, easier to set up and operate, etc.  It's a bit pricier than the cheaper ones, but the better design makes it worth it.  It handles softer veggies (zucchini, cucumbers) fairly well, but you do have to be careful of the diameter.  Still, it might be a good intro to the sport/art of cutting veggie noodlesIf, however, you have experienced the pleasures of a well designed ""crank"" style spiral cutter, you will be very disappointed in this.  The size makes it difficult to do larger veggies (sweet potatoes, rutabagas, etc.) without serious paring down to fit the small opening.  Also the effort needed to twist the holder with the veggie is not trivial.  As someone with shoulder and hand arthritis, I had difficulty with this.Even if you've never used a spiral cutter, it might be worth it to add a few bucks to the cost of this and go for the other Paderno hand crank cutter.  It's so much easier to use and you'll have more options (with less waste) of veggies to cut.  I've been using the larger Paderno cutter a couple of times a week now for about 6 months, and it's going strong with no sign of any failure.  Paderno makes quality stuff, and this little cutter appears to fit my quality expectations for the brand.  Pity it's not more useful/easier to use.I'm giving this an ""It's OK"" rating -- 3 stars.  Just not that useful for me; might be a good intro to veggie noodles for a novice."
Works great

A few years ago I bought a different brand of one of these.  I was very happy with how it worked.  I think that one was about $10.This Weber is bigger and the quality is far superior to my old one.  At $15 this chimney is a bargain.

"I love this handy kitchen gadget, I love making the twisty fries, but it also makes other vegetables look more inviting for both salads as well has side dishes.  It is fairly compact, all 3 of the different blades store right in the machine.  It is easy to use and very easy to clean up when you are finished using it.  The suction cups on the bottom of each leg hold it in place when preparing the food."
"Grandkids love these ""sodas"".  And I don't feel bad about letting them have some.  These are the perfect size for them.  Not too much waste that way.  They love most of the flavors that's available."

And I expect all 3 wolves to be howling, not just a couple with one lip-synching."
"arrived as expected, the pens are high quality and I was happy to see that when using it, the ink did not smudge and writing was clear.Very economical in the 24 pack. would recommend."
"This is great for skinny vegetables, such as zucchini or carrots. Because of the location of the blade in relation to the upright blade supports, this product breaks the curls apart from larger veggies such as sweet potatoes, apples etc. I purchased it for making Zoodles from zucchini, so I am fairly satisfied with the product. Love that the blade store in the bottom of the unit. Dishwasher safe is always a plus."
I love this juice it has a great taste! And love the carbonation. My favorites are Black cherry and grape!

"&gt;Vermont also has yet to answer how it will cover everyone. Vermonter here.   Good luck to us in maintaining the necessary levels of tax revenue to effectively fund a model single payer system when we have the oldest population in the U. S.  (and growing in numbers) coinciding with watching our 20 and 30 somethings leave Vermont to pursue job opportunities and business opportunities out of state.   It's unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most.Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence, who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most?   I'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer.   The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state's constitution before assuming powers not expressed.   If state lawmakers want the power to provide residents with a state based healthcare solution, lawmakers must ask us Vermonters for this power by referendum and amend the state constitution upon our consent."

After less than a month of use the little triangle metal blades started to break off one of the blades. At that point I had only used zucchini and sweet potato once. I now have to check all of my spiralized food to make sure there are no metal pieces that broke off as that could potentially be very painful to swallow. Other than that the spiralizer has worked pretty well.
"I loved my spiralizer that I got for Christmas (along with Inspiralized by Ali Maffucci) so much that I had to purchase this one as a gift. Everyone should have one.I was amazed to find out how many different veggies I can spiralize even now during the winter months (e.g., Broccoli, Jicama, Daikon Radish, Rutabaga, potato, Squash, Beets, Zucchini) I can't wait to spiralize the abundance of fresh veggies in the summer."

"Hutzler 571 Banana SlicerI recently purchased several Hutzler 571 Banana Slicers as gifts for some of my teaching colleagues at a major university here in DUrham NC, in celebration of the conclusion of this academic year... Here's a ""Thank You !"" note I received from one of them:""What an inspired gift you have given me!  First, it is a tremendous time saver. No more getting up two hours early to tediously measure, mark and measure again before cutting up the bananas, only to have to start all over again when the slices are not quite even. And the design and sunny yellow color make me smile every time I see it, like a big friendly sunrise early in the morning. I have saved so much time in the last week since you gave it to me that I have been able to finish my long awaited magnum opus, ""The Questions to Life's Great Answers"", and in my spare time, I have knitted 300 pairs of bobby socks for needy children in the Sudan. I'm now looking forward to beginning work on a life-size replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza in papier mâché and sand. When that's done, I'm hoping to recreate the Nile River in our backyard, complete with yearly flooding.In addition to my little projects, my husband has been inspired to begin work on a slightly smaller than life sized version of the Taj Mahal, in the back yard. Since he has no banana slicing duties in our home, I assume this project will take the greater part of several years to accomplish, but nevertheless, his inspiration came directly from the Hutzler Banana Slicer!How can I ever thank you enough for this thoughtful and life altering gift? I can hardly wait to share it with everyone on my gift giving list.""Recipient'S name withhelD"

Enormous sizing. Might have to return for smaller size.
"I bought these for my wife of 10 years hoping they would make her more efficient when performing her womenly chores.  Sadly, after owning them for two weeks the house is still dusty, the floors need sweeping, and my dinner is still never ready when I return home from a long day of work.She too complains that using these pens has kept her from watching her afternoon soap operas and she no longer knows who Victor Newman is married too."
Kinda bulky but I love the shapes this makes. Really easy to use.

"After researching pens for the past 12 weeks, ultimately the video showing the pens drawing by themselves is what convinced me these are the best pens money can by.Immediately after opening the package containing my Paper Mate InkJoy 300RT Retractable Medium Point Ballpoint Pens, they jumped from the box and started drawing everywhere, just as seen on the video.  To my surprise, after they had made their joyous exit from their box and drew their happiness of being free, they immediately got busy writing my report for me.  I got an ""A"" on it based solely on the artistic style of lettering and the array of bright colors.  The teacher said ""I was hypnotized by the beauty in the words and colors in this report. I wish I had amazing  pens like yours so I could write magical things people will remember for a lifetime.""  I went out that night and purchased my teacher her own set of pens.  I have never seen a teacher glow with excitement as much as she did when I presented her with her own set of magical InkJoy pens."

I was concerned with eating pasta for dinners and having such a heavy carbohydrate load before bed , but this spiralizer allows me to enjoy my ""pasta""by making it healthy. Top zucchini noodles with your favorite pesto or marinara sauce and you have a perfectly healthy meal.

I ordered a milk with vellocet, but the dobby devotcha shook her head and showed me a bottle of the Tuscan Whole. ""No vellocet, synthemesc, or drencrom needed my droog with this."" She said.

"I used to be gay, but after relentless disdain, oppression, and violence from my family, religious leaders, and town thugs, I became ex-gay. I am now happily married to a woman, and my weekend trips to the softball fields to watch her play are the highlights of my month! Regrettably, though, I've back-slid quite a number of times, and they've all been directly attributable to having just eaten a banana. It would start out innocently enough: I'd peel back the outer layer, exposing the tip. And then I would slide it into my mouth as its girth would gently push my cheeks aside. I would bite down ever-so-tenderly, testing the give and its limits before savoring its deliciousness. Yada, yada, yada, I'm in bed with another guy.But ever since my ex-gay therapist introduced me to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I've been able to eat this delicious, potassium-rich fruit without going past the point of no return!!! Now all I do is quickly peel the banana without touching the shaft too long, throw it onto the cutting board, and slam that slicer down. Bada bing, bada boom! It's rendered into 17 undistinguishable pieces that I can eat at my leisure with a fork or toothpick.Now I back-slide less frequently! Thank you Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer! You saved my marriage and my soul!PS: I'd give it 5-stars, but the thing is made of plastic, and it broke after slamming it down on the cutting board a little too vigorously one time."
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHA! HAHA! HA... Now I'm sad because this will never happen :(

"Yes, the war on Christmas rears its ugly head once more.  This year we will not see blinking lights on houses, decorated trees in homes, christmas services at church, christmas products for sale in every store nor even a single christmas-related advertisement.  To make it worse, no one may own a bible any more or celebrate christmas in their own homes. If you are jewish, muslim or a host of other religions, you are asked not to celebrate your own winter festivals as the mere presence of another holiday is a clear attack on christmas itself.

"The good news: No high fructose corn syrup, excellent flavor, and a deceivingly healthier optionThe bad news: more sugar and carbs than a regular soda.The flavors are great and the orange, lime, and grape taste like actual soda. I drink the occasionally sprite or ginger ale but soda is something off my list. The Switch drinks allow me to enjoy the sugary carbonated taste of soda without the chemicals and caffeine.If it's soda or Switch go with Switch but realize it is far from a diet drink and in 8 ounces has more sugar and carbs than a 12 ounce soda."

"The three wolf shirt... I have to say, I was a little skeptical based on the rave reviews this tshirt has gotten. However, the reality is quite remarkable. After putting on the 3 wolf shirt I got my best score in bowling that night! I quickly, within like 2 days, met a couple smoking hot women who commented on the shirt. I started going out with them and things were going really good but I got a little greedy and started dating too many women at once... And the whole thing kind of blew up in my face, but the reality is this shirt works! If you are not used to wolf shirts.. It may be better to start out with a 2 wolf or a single wolf shirt and work your way up..."
"I am replacing a Papermate pen I loved but ran out of ink too quickly. These write nicely, but not as smooth as some ball point pens I've used.

"This product probably deserves a higher rating, but just last month I watched ""Godzilla"" for the first time and I suspect it got my hopes up. (I should note the original Godzilla movie is an absolute marvel of film and is no doubt a five star product. highly recommended) Anyway, I have always been into lizards and recently purchased a cuban knight anole. The county fair is in a few months and I decided why not step up my game. The shipping was great: fast and the product came in great condition. However I have been unsuccessful at getting my lizard to ingest the uranium. He doesn't seem to want to eat it, he is much drier than he was before, and he no longer moves. I think instructions should be included with product, or at least more readily available online."
This is a favorite in the house.  The kids love it as a treat.  It's great as an afternoon pick me up at work.  It's also really nice with a bit of vodka or rum for the adults.  With that said - order them one case at a time.  We were buying them two cases (either two different flavors or a variety pack and one flavor that didn't come in the variety pack like fruit punch) but each time one of the two cases would shift during shipping and we would have a mess.  When we order only one at a time there is no problem.

What's interesting is that if you read more than the dust jacket he basically admits as much, arguing that while these relationships were meant to be celibate they probably didn't all live up to the ideal and that this created a social niche for homosexual men while not being exclusive to them.

Not too bad. Great flavor and better for you than soda. You shouldn't think that this is healthy for you though. Still a lot of sugar but it is natural sugar from the fruit juice. A better source for sugar than high fructose corn syrup but still sugar. (Not a fan of artificial sugars either) But if you are looking for a soda fix this is a good option and a lot of flavors.

"The doctor who wrote this article provides several heartbreaking examples of her past patients that show the emergency room solution is no solution at all.  FTA:&gt;... the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which states that hospitals with emergency rooms have to accept and stabilize patients who are in labor or who have an acute medical condition that threatens life or limb.  That word “stabilize” is key: Hospital ERs don’t have to treat you.  They just have to patch you up to the point where you’re not actively dying.  Also, hospitals charge for ER care, and usually send patients to collections when they cannot pay. The disregard of the poor by the likes of Cruz is shameful.   It is past time for a universal system."

I personally know a person who voted for his bullshit based solely on the premise of him giving away free birth control.  The new age on the rise in this nation is concerned more about the new iphone and kanye west's baby then their own rights and healthcare.  The way this nation is heading no wonder nations like China and India are taking our prosperity and economic growth, the west has become a place where people would rather fork out money to others to get their problems solved, instead of rolling up their sleeves and working, or at least trying.  To give you a story, I had a Chinese roommate in school who was attending college here in the US.  Now across the hall from us was a room with your normal college students, perhaps even smarter.  Now he offered anybody who could do his physics homework $20 to complete it, and who took the challenge, yes my Chinese roommate; who finished it in about 10 minutes.  It just goes to show you the mentality shift in this nation, we would rather spend then care, whether that goes for health care, labor, goods, etc.  Sorry about the rant, but if you think about the big picture it all ties into each other."

"It most definitely is.  How could it be construed as *not* some form of terrorism?  They are holding the very interests of America hostage until they get their demands met.  They are willing to let the economy crash and for Americans (of course, minus the *wealthy* Americans) suffer until they get their demands met. I hope that history and Americans are wise enough to judge these people as what they are: traitors.  In every sense of the word.  They have turned their backs on their country's best interests, their constituents, the history of America and are abusing their positions to kowtow to the needs of the wealthy exclusively.  That *is* terrorism.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: The GOP has done more damage to America than *any* terrorist organization in our lifetimes.  Yes, Al Qaeda had caused more life loss but the GOP has ruined the lives of millions of people and *continue* by fighting exclusively for the wealthy and corporations, taking food from the mouths of the need, the elderly, the young.... and the more damage they do, the more pride they seem to take in it. Jesus, I wish we could split the country into two separate nations.  I'd love to see how long the poor fools of GOP land last after they become enslaved to corporations and the rich.  There *would* be slavery again, without doubt, there would be a nation of 98% impoverished all struggling to help make profits for the 2% of the wealthy. Fuck the GOP.  And fuck the uneducated, uninformed people who cling to the ""both sides are the same"" mantra.  You understand absolutely nothing about politics, the economy, history or anything else that has to do with what's going on right now in America."

"I'm an ardent Leftist but I agree with him.  The moral relativism amongst my friends often descends into abstract lunacy with few people willing to definitively condemn or support anything for fear of offending someone else or being excoriated themselves.

So i like these juices & i really like the fact that they are all natural & gluten free! My 11yr old daughter absolutely loves them (they used to have them at her old school) And of course amazon has everything so i was very happy when i found them online. The only complaint that i have is that when they arrived about 98% of the cans were all DENTED!!!! Pretty aggravating!!  But since i like the juice so much i decided to keep them but i will be writing amazon to let them know about my frustration with this.
Exactly as advertised.

I have done zuchhini a couple times using the small noodle blade. Sautéed the noodles in a little olive and butter and sprinkled on some imported Pecorino Romano cheese. Delish!

"It works, but the marketing is kind of a scam. Does Hutzer make a banana peeler? Sure, but don't go thinking it's included or, like me, you're gonna get your slicer and realize it's about as useful as a roll of paper towels without a paper towel dispenser until you pony up more cash and wait. (And, oh the wait feels endless.) Fortunately, or not, during my second purchase I had the foresight to consider what other essential ""upgrades"" I need just to make use of the original product.Let's just say that it all works beautifully, the banana scouring powder and polishing cloth, the peeler, the slicer, and the 13-head-rotating-banana-slicer-scrub-brush all deliver as promised, but I hope the excitement of flawless bananas on the kids' Christmas morning Cheerios is present enough from Santa this year. In fairness, the banana de-threader and banana seed extractor were probably unnecessary luxuries. But then again, were they? It's not as though I splurged on the titanium and redwood display case. (Honestly, at a quarter the price, the stainless steel and artisan-selected oak gets the job done without being unnecessarily ostentatious.)Part of me feels like we could have made due with just a cigar cutter, the appropriate violin strings, 1.25"" and 3.75"" duct tape, a repurposed loom and/or the spokes from the front wheel of a brass unicycle, a yard of bacteria-resistant crushed velvet, a baker's dozen of My Little Pony mane and tailbrushes, a set of resurfaced wooden dominoes, a pair of needle-nosed surgical-grade tweezers, and a well-trained midget.

He personally, was the sole or co-developer of over 75 models during the 80's(models 342 thru 417) He died a broken man, helping to develop the perfect banana slicer that you so casually mock! When dad passed I decided to take up his work because I was determined to not see his lifelong dream go unfulfilled! I worked tirelessly, just like Dad to help make that dream a reality! Unfortunately for me, both of my arms were ripped off while testing an experimental banana-slicing prototype. I was told that my injuries could have been much worse because the prototype was programmed to seek out banana shaped objects! Anyway, I am typing this review with my nose, in the hopes that you will cease your insensitive comments  and APPRECIATE something that so many people put so much hard work and sacrifice into! Thank you."
Like they need more incentive not to do their jobs. The bill would trigger across the board 1% cuts every 90 days until they pass a continuing resolution.
"Baptists, evangelicals, church of christ/god, etc all couldn't give two shits what the pope does.   He doesn't represent them or their views of church doctrine.   Catholics really only make up 25% of our country so it doesn't surprise me that the GOP isn't tied to what the pope says."
I hope the Democratic Party is sending this guy wine and roses.
"I am part of a writing group and chose to try these pens.  I LOVE them! The shape is wonderful and the colors are great!  I am a lefty, so watch for pens that don't smear as my hand passes over the ink - this ink dries quickly and hasn't smeared once.  I noticed a reviewer complained about the pens not putting out ink immediately upon his writing - he should read the packaging, which says there is a little drop of sealant on each pen to protect it until you use it. Remove that, and you're in business!!"

"The amazing fact is that fans of right wing radio, tv, etc. , who are mostly upper middle class, actually believe that the ""rich"" Do create jobs and wealth for the middle class. These suckers only need to pull out a 5-10 year old paystub, and the one from last week to see the proof.  Cost of living has gone up 30-55% for the average middle class family, depending on where you live------and they still don't get it. Goebbels said if you tell a lie consistently, it becomes truth. Good article.  I've been saying this for years.  It is in the 1% best interest to share the wealth, but 99% of them don't. Oh well."

"&gt; Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development involved with those industries, or government contracting.  Some hard working and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before retirement but they are rare. &gt;Folks in the top 0. 1% come from many backgrounds but it's infrequent to meet one whose wealth wasn't acquired through direct or indirect participation in the financial and banking industries. &gt; Most of the serious economic damage the U. S.  is struggling with today was done by the top 0. 1% and they benefited greatly from it. &gt; A highly complex set of laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the uppermost reaches of the U. S.  financial system.  It allows them to protect and increase their wealth and significantly affect the U. S.  political and legislative processes.  They have real power and real wealth.  Ordinary citizens in the bottom 99. 9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood of entering the top 0. 5%, much less the top 0. 1%.  Moreover, those at the very top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. So, basically investment bankers, etc have taken over and are now running - and ruining - our country.  They are an existential threat - left alone, their actions **will** kill us.  What do we do about them?  They have so completely twisted the laws so there seems to be no legal recourse for their actions, which suggests the only ways to protect ourselves are extra-legal...  Hopefully, I am wrong, and there are still legal ways to counter them, because otherwise the future will be disastrous, no matter who wins."

She seems to make a point of knowing nothing about anything.  For example the assault weapons ban is one of her big things and yet she seems to lack even a cursory knowledge about guns. I just don't get how someone whose job affects the entire country can't talk to an expert or read a fucking wikipedia article every once in a while.

What's great about this is Obama is really calling him to the mat.  If a vote were called and didn't pass it would legitimize the GOP BS.  If it passes Boehner is finished.  Obama is basically telling Boehner to bet his career.  Love it.

I am assuming that the box was damaged during shipping but if the box was bigger with enough padding, the cans could have been safe.

"Finally a Big and Tall T-Shirt that fits and is long enough to tuck in and not pull out every time you sit down.  100% cotton, medium weight comfortable.  A bit stiff out of the package, takes a few washings to soften up."

So the ends justify the means?
"Unfortunately, they can't.  At least for the 30-40 odd gerrymandered Deep South House seats the GOP created that ensure that, even with a national Democratic sweep, they'll remain Republican districts.  To say nothing of the further steps these states have taken to restrict valid voters from exercising their franchise. Anti-democratic?  You betcha! Besides, the Republican Party makes too much money off these extremists to remove them from their group. About the only saving grace to this is that the GOP ""moderates"" (they only want to strangle public education, Social Security &amp; Medicare in its crib, versus blow its face off with a shotgun) have lost control and must now kowtow to these lunatics."

"I believe it would be right cool if the Democrats just took over the position of 'conservative' party.  They do all the consertive stuff quite well--pandering to big money, spying on citizens, grossly mismanaging public resources.  The U. S.  hasn't had a progressive party for many years."
Great pens at a reasonable price with quick shipping. They write smoothly and that makes life a little easier.
"I don't know enough about climatology to confirm nor deny.  That being said, I know I don't like pollution."
Worth every penny. Makes lighter fluid unnecessary and lights the coal much quicker.
Perfect
It was still an incredibly lucrative investment for the Kochs.   I'm sure they made a fucking killing from the total chaos it created in our government and the (hopefully) temporary destruction of protections for the middle and lower classes from a total corporate takeover. Mission absolutely accomplished.
That kid is awesome.
Not sure if the price of product is worth it.  Taste great.
My 15 yr old son has been shutting us off... Hanging out only with his best friend Kyle ... When I was cleaning his room the other day I found these bic pens under his mattress along with fake eyelashes and ladies' underwear.. I talked to him and he opened up and came out to me. I could see the relief in his eyes. I hugged him and told him I would always love him no matter what his sexual orientation but if he EVER TOOK MY BIC PENS AGAIN I WOULD f&@₪ KILL him. Thanks bic for bringing a family back together
"I paid about 1 dollar a can, and considering there's less liquid than traditional soft drink cans, you're paying A LOT for what you get.That aside, they are fairly good. I really like the watermelon flavor (surprisingly!).Give them a try, although I won't be buying them again due to the price."
"Bought to add to Spirograph set....nice variety of colors, work well, great value!"
"His favorite color is Coca Cola, he clearly knows whats up."
"These are just okay as far as taste. The cans are a little smaller than normal, but the variety pack was a decent value. Definitely seems a bit healthier than some of the other soft drinks choices that are out there."

If you use charcoal buy a chimney starter. Really easy and way quicker than dealing with other methods. I use a side burner for starting but most people use newspaper with no problem. Can't say if this unit is better than others but it does what it is advertised to do!
Remember when the same people who are now banning WE THE PEOPLE from public property and land were telling us the 'occupiers' had every right to be there ?
I absolutely love this spiraler. Use it every week.
"my son gets these from school and he loves them.  They are all natural.  Pretty high in sugars, but nothing added.  I also like the small size.  Limits servings."
Taste fantastic.
"I really don't get his thinking with this.  He either thought this was actually true, which means he's an utter moron, or he knows it was a huge lie which means he's a complete piece of shit.  Either way he looks bad eventually for saying this once the truth comes out so I'm not sure what his end game was here."
Finally some good pens. Easy to write and nice to hold in my hands. The ink flows nicely and I like my own writing once again.

"Seriously.  I would not describe hannity (which my phone autocorrected to ham mitt) as being destroyed in this video.  He wasn't even made speechless.  I'd say the video should be called ""Athirst doesn't get flustered by Sean Hannity""."

"I had been wondering what to get the women in my life for Christmas.

"Great, smooth-writing pens for a decent price. They seem to run out a little faster than traditional pens, though. Not sure if that's because of the smooth-flowing ink or I just write a lot."
Fit and quality is as expected

Discovering this pen made me realize this is the reason I flunked school. I wasn't able to use the over-sized man pens and pencils that I had to use. My only wish is that these had come out sooner so I could have done better. Who am I kidding I would have also had to know how to read. :(

This is very good but only 4 stars due to they need to make it in bigger cans! Besides that I loved it.
The really important question is why the fuck do we keep talking about Limbaugh?
"Great pens, they write smoothly. I don't know how much value is added with the new InkJoy technology but they are definitely better than a basic pen. Have yet to have one run dry, so they last a while. the grip is also good."

I love the product - it spiralizes all kinds of vegetables and fruits beautifully.  We're now eating more vegetables with our meals and snacks.  My only criticism is that it is built for a right-handed person (Paderno Model that sells for $29.90 on Amazon).  My wife is left-handed so it has become a team effort to spiralize the vegetables and fruit.  I would love to see the pushing handle on both sides or at least moveable to the opposite side.  I would even be agreeable to a separately purchasable crank and handle attachment for a left-handed person at a reasonable cost. Follow-up Note:  There is a left and right handed Paderno spiralizer that sells on Amazon for $48.23).  I found it when I typed William Sonoma Spiralizer to see if they sold a left-hand version.

I used my first one at a Drs office and fell in love.  I really like the smooth and easy flow.  You can get them in different varieties so these are easy to hold with arthritis.  But the flow is like magic. I am going to use tmen in my new spirograph.  Love the pen and its flow.
Getting damage control advice from Rush?
Note it says China RAISED not China PROCESSED.  More food safety concerns are at the processing side of the equation rather than at the farm.  The USDA has repeatedly found that China's food safety protocols at their processing plants are not up to par with US standards and therefore continue to ban imports of meat that was butchered in China.

Great pens for a medium tip. They write with little effort and are very reliable. Very cost effective for a quality retractable.
"You can't handle the truth! Son we live in a world that needs milk, and those have to be delivered by men with trucks. Whose gonna do it you, you lieutenant Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and his lactose intolerance, and you curse the milkmen. You have that luxury, you have the luxury of not knowing what I know, that Santiago's lactose intolerance while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence while grotesque and incomprehensible, to you, saves milk. You don't want the truth because deep down in places you talk about in coffee shops; you want me on that delivery route, you need me on that delivery route! We use words like whole, expiration date, pasteurization, We use these words as the backbone of a life spent delivering something, you use them as a punch line.

I don't know how any progressive isn't pissed off about this bill.   I know I am and I consider myself pretty far left. This bill is the worst of both worlds and sets the chances of true UHC back a decade.   Which is what we need because without single-payer health care costs will continue to spiral out of control.

"So I was disappointed to find out the milk wasn't blue when I poured it in my plastic cup. I guess ""Tuscan"" isn't a fancy, marketing-saavy way of spelling ""Tusken"". I thought $45 seemed like too good of a deal for shipping from Tatooine."
Hey we have something in common!

"I was just a mere lass in me mammie's gave just a wee bit of this milk don't ya know. I was just singing and dancing girlie don't ya know. Now, that I grown dearie, everyday I day since darling I've been going to milk'sanoyous. I am milk alcoholic, oh God help me, but I just can't get enough of the stuff and I've taken going to the grocery store goodness me a stealing the stuff. If I just ween myself off the stuff, but I just can't help myself darlin. It's so good that I dream at least I think that maybe I hate to admit it but I start drinking milk early in the morning twen and I went to see the pope, to see redemption for me wee soul, but he go tired off seeing me sorry tass in the confessional and he going to retire on February 28 of tis year. Oh God help me he give on me soul and I am doomed to be hook on the yummie stuff for the rest of me wretched life."
"Whatever faith I might have had in Ted Cruz is completely, utterly, gone.  He somehow forgets what a democracy means and wants everything his way.  He's like a little kid who threatens to take his ball and go home.  In my book, he has already committed political suicide.  I'm sure he'll make plenty of bucks on the book and speaking circuit."
"As many reviewers here have stated, this is a great product! The coals heat up much faster than when you douse lighter fluid on the coals. And all of the coals get lit, instead of having some unlit coals. Pro tip: DO NOT use match-light charcoal with this unless you want a four-foot high inferno of flames. The only downside is that it is annoying to store in my tiny apartment. I don't have anywhere to put it, so I store it in my trunk year round."
"I wish I had known about the 571 before I invested in the diamond-tipped industrial bandsaw I purchased weeks ago for my banana slicing workshop. The Hutzler 571 slices bananas so efficiently, I had to lay off twelve of my banana slicing specialists because we were just getting a surplus of banana slices in a fraction of the time. It really helps my bottom line, but it may be hurting the banana slicing industry.One question I would ask: is there an attachment that can make the slices in shapes other than circular? I hope I don't seem ungrateful... now that handcrafted banana slices are so easy to make, maybe I'm taking it for granted, but perhaps it's time for triangular or rhomboid slices. Here's hoping that multiple-shape functionality will be added to the Hutzler 572."
you can't fixed stupid.
Than you for checkingI'm very pleased with my purchase.  N will recommend it to my friends n family
This thing is absolutely amazing!  Highly recommend!

That's hilarious.
I think they taste great
"I bought a case of these and I find them to be pretty tasty!  Their a little small, but that can serve a purpose as well.  Beware though, they are not low calorie because they are fruit juice!"
"And 50 years ago a kid would be terrified to let their parents read their diary.  The web isn't the problem, nor are the parents.  The fact of life is that kids do things their parents don't like, and no matter how those things are recorded kids would always prefer some privacy."
"For the same reason mega churches are popular, and you keep hearing about a new, no investment needed real estate plan or method on the radio. Greed is easy.   Giving and caring is hard."
"I love most of the switch flavors, and subscribe to them thru Amazon.  Tastes great, no sugar, and lots of vitamin C.  I have a can every day with my breakfast."
"Back in grade school when I was still a believer this would bother me so much.  Christian schools, youth groups, family get-togethers, where ever I was it was always uncomfortable watching people jump at the chance to lead prayer or throwing out prayer requests just to be part of something.  Listening to someone use ""Lord"" as a filler in prayer just as you'd use ""Um"" or ""Like"".  Or, god forbid, when I was ""volunteered"" for it.  What was I supposed to do?  I know they were just trying to include me and I don't want to start a debate on the ethics of public prayer right before we eat.  It's not even an obscure verse either.  It's in the first gospel.  You can't even say that it was only applicable for it's time and place.  Like, half of Jesus's mission was preaching against the pretentious self righteousness of the religious leaders.  Trying to cut through the bullshit and make religion more personal.  To this day it bothers me.  It's like, if you're going to be all religiousy then at least FOLLOW YOUR OWN DAMN RELIGION."
"You ever wanted the government to put you on the ""No Fly List"", purchase plenty of this and take it to an airport. You would never get back on a plane again O:-)"
"Yes I would agree their faith is just as earnest as ours, but like the article said, the theology of Mormonism is very different from main stream Christianity and is cleverly worded on the surface to look alike, but deep down in the specifics, Mormonism and most main line Christian Church theology is very different.  So i wouldn't call it exclusivity, if the president of the LDS church said himself that he wants Christians outside of the LDS to come and change ""their Jesus"".  I don't think that will help, but maybe it will.  Love to keep talking about it with you."
"I was so excited to get on there for my husband to see what he will qualify for, but there are just too many people trying to use it right now."
Needed retractable pens for a reasonable and this fit the bill.
This joke is so boring now.  I'm surprised when I don't see it posted about any piece of computer hardware news.
"I am a Young Earth Creationist, but I've never truly looked into it.  As far as I know(this is an extremely dumbed-down version), scientists look at rocks and their natural processes today and use that to estimate how old the earth is.  However, they assume that the rocks natural processes were always like this, and they are not taking in the account of a possible global flood that may have lasted roughly a year(Yes, I know if you are Atheist you more than likely don't believe this story to be true)."
"&gt; But in our country, like it or not, Congress has most of the power. Yeah, so she has the most power, then divided by 100 so it's not the most power anymore. She's the (or very close to) the most progressive senator.   The President is still the world's most powerful person.   There's no sane person who approves of her politics but would rather see her stay in the Senate."
Love love love love love!!!!!  This is so easy to use and works wonderfully!!!!  I did quite a bit of on line research before deciding on this product. It certainly paid off.  The design is genius!  It is so compact and efficient.  I would recommend this highly for anyone looking for one of the many out on the market.
Coals were red in 5 minutes.
This is a great shirt. Well made and comfortable. Order a size down or two sizes if your looking for something snug. Shrink to fit and air dry on the next washes after. You and this shirt will get the job done.

"I didn't buy mine off Amazon, but I really like mine.  When I think of all the lighter fluid I've gone through, the inconvenience of keeping one more flammable on hand--well you get the picture.  This works every time.  Predictably.  All I need is scrap newsprint,wad it up, light it and wait 15 to 30 minutes and I have a bed of hot, burning coals.  I write a lot of 5 star reviews because I review things I like, but this would rate 5 stars both for quality and value."
Simply awesome.  We haven't stopped using it.  It's a great way to get the kids to eat their veggies and a healthy way to get rid of heavy carbs in dishes (i.e. pasta).  We wish we would have purchased this sooner.
I use lump charcoal in my smoker and this cuts my readiness time buy 60%.  Even dense lump like mesquite and oak is popping and glowing in under 10 minutes.  Just don't wear flip flops when using lump in this!

Amazing device.  Easy to use and clean.  Makes fabulous noodles out of zucchini and sweet potatoes.  You can use as pasta or make hash browns.  You will love this!
"I think that aspect of the verse lacks punch because:1.  Ordinary people make great sacrifices all the time. 2.  God can just snap his fingers and do or undo anything, so if his pie is burning, it's hard to feel sorry for him. 3.  If we start talking about the Trinity in this context our brains will melt. So I think it's hard to get hopped up on this verse.  It reminds me of cases where a Christian has announced that Christ's sacrifice was the greatest possible because crucifixion is the worst thing possible that can happen to anyone.  I can name a few things that I would gladly submit to crucifixion in order to avoid.  Hint: Mary endured one of those. TL;DR: Adam is trying to start a circle jerk."

I'm totally going to be prepared now when Mitt Romney needs more binders full of women. Perhaps BIC can form a partnership with a binder company in anticipation.

"Let be a little more intelligent here.   Back in those days, having a child out of wedlock was socially unacceptable regardless of your religion or background.   Those that did were stigmatized as 'whores'.   In fact, it wasn't until 1973 that the Supreme Court ruled that fathers of illegitimate children had a legal responsibility to them.   Different times. While the free love movement of the 1960s was starting to change that it did not have much of an impact on middle class America.   Wasn't just Catholic families.   In the 1960s we went from 5% out of wedlock births to our current rate of upwards of 40%.

Might seem/feel cheap when you first open it but it does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well.  No complaints or issues.
Love It!
Great shirt. Well made.
Works great. Use it everyday .
"I bought this because I enjoyed it at school. Even though I like what I bought from Amazon, it is not as sparkling as what I drank in high school."
"My coworker bought one of these units for our advanced culinary class of high school skill center students.  They were working with the Washington State Potato Board to create healthy alternatives for middle school student's lunches.This worked like a champ to make interesting healthy options for the students since we used an air fryer to cook the potatoes strings.While it worked for a small volume, we were not able to produce enough easily for a large volume.  This is great for a family's needs.  In that sense, the culinary students learned what could be made but also learned the limitations of volume."
"Love writing with these pens. Extremely smooth, though it will end up getting on you after a while. The finger rest also starts to move around rather quickly."

"Having seen all the positive reviews on this I figured I couldn't go wrong.. and I didn't.  I thought I was cool using lighter made from a cutoff golf club with silicone hose and propane tank, but if it was either too windy or not windy, that method required me  to stand there and tend it.  With this, don't forget to buy the white lighter cubes, light one and sit a starter full of charcoal over it.  Wait 20 minutes, dump it out and you are good to go with blazing red hot coals.  Also, don't forget to buy the nomex gloves... the two handles get too hot to handle without protection.  This is just so simple and works so well.  I use lump charcoal in it.  Hope it holds up."

"These pens aren't quite as nice as the last time I ordered them. Upon use of the first pen it didn't allow a constant supply of ink, instead it would dry from time to time and immediately after allow too much ink. I'm only one pen into the lot of them so I'll report back."

"Extremely important! Amazon and people of the begining of the XXI century. I have been traveling though time for the last three decades to deliver this message to the people of the past. Do not, I repeat, do not buy, sell or make any more comments about this product. This ore was used to contaminate our world. Now our present (your future) has been devastated by apocalyptic zombies, radioactive Godzillas, North Korean dictators and jihadists, Chernobyl like disasters, mutants, 7 world wars and Amazon database was overrun by too many comments about uranium ore. I repeat, do not sell, buy or contribute with comments for the proliferation of this ore."
I have used this on several occasions since it arrived.  It makes neat work of spiralizing vegetables for quick cooking and adding to pasta for a lighter meal.  It makes for a fun time in the kitchen.

"This Massachusetts liberal did so much harm to the Conservative cause it isn't even funny.

Some of the pens did not work property (didn't stay out when writing did not retract properly either.)
"Every morning I had to run along my husband as he rode his bike so that I could slice my banana in the spokes. Random bikers would be angry if I swiped at their tires with my banana. It was very tedious picking the slices out of my neighbors yards. Quite frankly, more than one family was exasperated with me since clippings from newly mowed grass made the job difficult. I started petitions to only allow grass cutting in the afternoon after breakfast is consumed. Thanks to Hutzler, I am once again on good terms with the neighborhood association, and my back isn't cramped up from stooping along a moving cyclist."
Excellent pens.I have reordered several times. My favorite pen.
"We know the Earth is vastly older than 10,000 years old for a huge variety of reasons.  Just to name a few:Amino acid racemization, Baptistina asteroid family, Continental drift, Coral, Cosmogenic nuclide dating, Dendrochronology, Distant starlight, Erosion, Fission track dating, Geomagnetic reversals, Helioseismology, Human Y-chromosomal ancestry, Ice layering, Impact craters, Iron-manganese nodule growth, Lack of DNA in fossils, Length of the prehistoric day, Lunar retreat, Naica megacrystals, Nitrogen impurities in natural diamonds, Oxidizable carbon ratio dating, Permafrost, Petrified wood, Radioactive decay, Relativistic jets, Rock varnish, Seabed plankton layering, Sedimentary varves, Space weathering, Stalactites, Thermoluminescence dating, and Weathering rinds.  Really though, this is just a short list.  Virtually all we currently understand about physics, chemistry, and geology leads us to a conclusion of an old Earth and universe.  All of the evidence we currently have available indicates this. &gt;... and they are not taking in the account of a possible global flood... There is no evidence to suggest that at any point in time Earth was fully covered with water or oceans.  Having ""never looked into it"" your confusion is understandable.  Edit: Like someone else said.  On an order of magnitude of how far off Creationists are it's equivalent to believing that New York City and Los Angeles are like 20ft away from each other."
"We've used the spiralizer almost everyday since we've owned it.  I'm very happy with how the ""noodles"" turn out in terms of size and texture.  We found better success with large carrots, zucchini and squash if you cut them in half before going to the spiralizer.  You get a few extra ""food pucks"" that get stuck in the tines but they are perfectly usable and edible.  I dare say you actually get to spiralize a solid 95% of what you are trying to process."
"A perfect alternative to soda!  For the price, you can not beat it. And it is good for them! You won't be disappointed."

"Are they always that wide?  Ours are pretty narrow, about half the width, I'd say."
"The question was extra much not ""how do we make sure artists are paid"", since the big copyright conglomerations don't give a crap about that.  They are all about *themselves* getting paid.  The artists generally should consider themselves lucky if they get the equivalent of minimum wage, especially if they are musicians. Before this: http://www. salon. com/2000/06/14/love_7/ I had little respect for Courtney Love, but after that I have a little more.  Anyway, the way to ensure art is made and is available is very simple, decouple all humans now living from the need to ""earn a living"".  Convert to a moneyless, classless, nationless word built on cooperation and resource sharing and far more artists than now will have the time and resources to focus on their craft instead of flipping burgers 10 hours a day to make ends meet.

"These are excellent canned ""sodas"", with great flavor.  They obviously use concentrated apple juice to kick up the sweetness, so you don't really decrease your sugar intake much if any, and they are carbonated so if you don't like that feature they are not for you.  Myself, I like both of those facts.  They provide a very refreshing change from a cola or typical lemon-lime drink and still have the carbonation.  Plus they have better, more ""natural"" flavor than most of the flavored sodas on grocery store shelves.My only complaint is they size (reason for only 4 stars) -- only 8 ounces, but if you have children under 12 (or are an elderly slender woman) this is probably perfect size."
It ruined Paul Ryan's childhood because he's still a very confused little Eddie Munster.
"I used to pirate videogames, then Steam came along and i stopped. I used to pirate music, then Spotify came along and i stopped.

I still pirate TV shows which aren't on Netflix, because fuck waiting sometimes a year or so to watch stuff that's aired in the USA."
This is my favorite kitchen gadget. There is so much you can do with it and so many great spiralized recipes on the internet. I particularly love the Inspiralized Blog.
These have a really great flavor. Favorite by far is the strawberry watermelon flavor. Most of them are great a few are so so.
Bought this shirt and few other colors for landscaping.  I wore this green one once all day had gotten dirty and sweaty.  Came home and washed it that night.  Well took out of wash and the sweat marks bleached the shirt and would not wash out.  So I guess the coloring is not so good on them.  Glad I bought gray for the other ones.

"As it states in the fine print on the label, ""Call your doctor if you have an erection lasting more than 4 hours after drinking Tuscan whole milk.""  They should really make this warning more obvious.  Six hours into my boner I passed out and awoke covered in Tuscan whole milk."
"We absolutely LOVE this ""soda"".  We do not like the usual sodas, or flavored water.  But this was very nice and sweet, its a treat.  The kids loved all the flavors, we drink tons of water and this is a nice change.  My husband and I really liked the watermelon and & the kiwi"

"My husband loves the shirts! Nice thick, but not warm thick, material. It is so hard to find this size in the store so I loved that I was able to find them on Amazon (and for a better price!)."
Why would you waste money developing and marketing a pen for women? They don't need a special pen just to write a grocery list.I would seriously reconsider buying stock in a mismanaged company such as Bic.

"These get-skinny-quick schemes usually work...in the short term. Yes, you lose weight fast and end up with a squeaky clean colon, but a large percentage of the weight loss was (heavy) water weight and hair loss.
